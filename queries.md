## SQL Queries

All data populated to database are authentic real-world data the are captured from following resources using scripts or manually:

* [whoscored.com](https://www.whoscored.com)
* [footballdatabase.eu](http://www.footballdatabase.eu)
* [England 2015/16 - Premier League Match Details](http://www.rsssf.com/tablese/eng2016det.html)
* [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org)

Due to constraint of time, only a small amount of data is populated, which is enough to run the queries but not to give the real-world results.

### (1)

**Objective:** Find names of people who worked for a team as both player and manager, as well as the names of the teams.

```sql
SELECT (p.first_name || ' ' || p.last_name) AS name, t.name AS team
FROM people p, players pl, teams t, (
	SELECT cw.tid AS tid, pw.pid AS pid
	FROM player_works pw, coach_works cw
	WHERE pw.team=cw.tid AND (pw.pid, cw.cid) IN (
		SELECT pl1.pid, c1.cid
		FROM people p1, players pl1, coaches c1
		WHERE p1.pid=pl1.person_id AND p1.pid=c1.pid)
	) AS temp
WHERE pl.pid=temp.pid AND pl.person_id=p.pid AND t.tid=temp.tid;
```

**Explanations:**

* line 6 - find player and coach pairs that are the same person;
* line 3 - find the team in which that person worked as both player and coach;
* line 1 - print the person's name and team's name.

**Results:**

```
      name       |       team       
-----------------+------------------
 Zin√©dine Zidane | Real Madrid C.F.
 Josep Guardiola | FC Barcelona
(2 rows)

```

### (2)

**Objective:** For each match, when applicable, find the score vs. average player ratings (player overall ratings range 0-100)

```sql
SELECT ms.mid, home_score, home_rating_avg, away_score, away_rating_avg
FROM matches ms,
	
	(SELECT m.mid, AVG(p.rating) AS home_rating_avg
	FROM matches m, player_plays pp, players p
	WHERE m.mid=pp.mid AND pp.pid=p.pid AND pp.home_side=true
	GROUP BY m.mid) AS home,
	
	(SELECT m.mid, AVG(p.rating) AS away_rating_avg
	FROM matches m, player_plays pp, players p
	WHERE m.mid=pp.mid AND pp.pid=p.pid AND pp.home_side=false
	GROUP BY m.mid) AS away

WHERE ms.mid=home.mid AND ms.mid=away.mid;
```

**Explanations:**

* line 4 - find the average rating of *home* team for each match;
* line 9 - find the average rating of *away* team for each match;
* line 1 - join both ratings by match ID, then print out scores and ratings of both sides.

**Results:**

```
 mid | home_score |   home_rating_avg   | away_score |   away_rating_avg   
-----+------------+---------------------+------------+---------------------
   6 |          2 | 85.0000000000000000 |          0 | 83.3000000000000000
(1 row)
```


### (3)

**Objective:** Find the names of Arsenal players who scored the most goals in matches against rival teams. (A new table *rivaries* is created for the information of [soccer derbies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_sports_rivalries_in_the_United_Kingdom#England_and_Wales.23Basketball) that was not included in Part 1)

```sql
CREATE TEMP TABLE temp_arsenal_tid AS
SELECT tid FROM teams WHERE name='Arsenal';

CREATE TEMP TABLE temp_rival_teams AS
SELECT tid1 AS tid FROM rivaries JOIN temp_arsenal_tid ON tid2=tid
UNION
SELECT tid2 AS tid FROM rivaries JOIN temp_arsenal_tid ON tid1=tid;

CREATE TEMP TABLE temp_player_match AS
SELECT temp.pid, temp.mid
FROM 
	(SELECT p.pid, m.away_team AS tid, m.mid
	FROM player_plays p JOIN matches m ON p.mid=m.mid
	WHERE p.home_side=true AND m.home_team=(SELECT tid FROM temp_arsenal_tid)
	
	UNION

	SELECT p.pid, m.home_team AS tid, m.mid
	FROM player_plays p JOIN matches m ON p.mid=m.mid
	WHERE p.home_side=false AND m.away_team=(SELECT tid FROM temp_arsenal_tid)
	) AS temp
WHERE temp.tid IN (SELECT tid FROM temp_rival_teams)
GROUP BY temp.pid, temp.mid;

CREATE TEMP TABLE temp_player_goals AS
SELECT t.pid, COUNT(*) AS goals
FROM temp_player_match t JOIN player_scores s ON t.pid=s.pid AND t.mid=s.mid
WHERE NOT s.is_owngoal=true
GROUP BY t.pid;

SELECT (p.first_name || ' ' || p.last_name) AS name, t.goals
FROM players pl, people p, temp_player_goals t
WHERE pl.pid=t.pid AND pl.person_id=p.pid AND t.goals=
	(SELECT MAX(t1.goals) FROM temp_player_goals t1);
```

**Explanations:**

* (had to create temporary tables as this was far more complicated)
* line 1 - find the team ID of Arsenal;
* line 4 - find the rival teams of Arsenal;
* line 12/18 - find the matches and opponent teams an Arsenal player played against in home/away matches;
* line 9 - find the matches with opponent teams being rival teams;
* line 25 - find the total goals each player scored in these matches;
* line 31 - find the name of Arsenal player with the most such goals scored.

**Results:**

```
      name      | goals 
----------------+-------
 Alexis Sanchez |     2
(1 row)
```
