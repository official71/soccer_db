'zone':3787	Leicester City Football Club (/lstr sti/), also known as the Foxes, is an English professional football club based at the King Power Stadium in Leicester.[2] They compete in the Premier League, Englands highest division of football. Having been promoted as champions of the Football League Championship in 201314, this signalled a return to the top flight of English football after a decade away. The club was founded in 1884 as Leicester Fosse F.C.,[3] playing on a field near Fosse Road. They moved to Filbert Street in 1891, were elected to the Football League in 1894 and adopted the name Leicester City in 1919. They moved to the nearby Walkers Stadium in 2002,[4] which was renamed the King Power Stadium after a change of ownership in 2011. Leicester City won the 201516 Premier League, their first top-level football championship. They are one of only six clubs to have won the Premier League since its inception in 1992. A number of newspapers described their title win as the greatest sporting upset ever, considering at the start of the season they were favourites to face relegation.[5] Multiple bookmakers had never paid out at such long odds for any sport.[6][7][8] Due to the magnitude of the clubs title win, it went down in English football history as one of the games finest ever achievements. The clubs previous highest ever finish was second place in the top flight, in Division One in 192829. Throughout Leicesters history, they have spent all but one season within the top two leagues of English football. They hold a joint-highest seven second-tier titles (six Second Division and one Championship). The club have been FA Cup finalists four times, in 194849, 196061, 196263 and 196869. This is a tournament record for the most defeats in the final without having won the competition. City have several promotions to their name, two play-off final wins, and one League One title. In 1971, they won the FA Community Shield, and in 2016, they were runners up. They have also won the League Cup three times in 1964, 1997 and 2000, as well as being runners up in 196465 and 1999. In addition, Leicester City have competed in European football, with their appearances coming in the 196162 European Cup Winners Cup, 199798 UEFA Cup, 200001 UEFA Cup, and most recently the 201617 UEFA Champions League, reaching the quarter-finals of the competition in that year.   Formed in 1884 by a group of old boys of Wyggeston School as Leicester Fosse, the club joined The Football Association (FA) in 1890.[9] Before moving to Filbert Street in 1891, the club played at five different grounds, including Victoria Park south-east of the city centre and the Belgrave Road Cycle and Cricket Ground.[10] The club also joined the Midland League in 1891, and were elected to Division Two of the Football League in 1894 after finishing second. Leicesters first ever Football League game was a 43 defeat at Grimsby Town, with a first League win the following week, against Rotherham United at Filbert Street. The same season also saw the clubs largest win to date, a 130 victory over Notts Olympic in an FA Cup qualifying game.[3] In 190708 the club finished as Second Division runners-up, gaining promotion to the First Division, the highest level of English football. However, the club were relegated after a single season which included the clubs record defeat, a 120 loss against Nottingham Forest.[3][11] In 1919, when League football resumed after World War I, Leicester Fosse ceased trading due to financial difficulties of which little is known. The club was reformed as Leicester City Football Club, particularly appropriate as the borough of Leicester had recently been given city status. Following the name change, the club enjoyed moderate success in the 1920s; under the management of Peter Hodge, who left in May 1926 to be replaced two months later by Willie Orr, and with record goalscorer Arthur Chandler in the side,[12] they won the Division Two title in 192425[13] and recorded their second-highest league finish in 192829 as runners-up by a single point to Sheffield Wednesday.[9] However the 1930s saw a downturn in fortunes, with the club relegated in 193435[14] and, after promotion in 193637,[15] another relegation in 193839 would see them finish the decade in Division Two.[3][16] City reached the FA Cup final for the first time in their history in 1949,[3][17] losing 31 to Wolverhampton Wanderers. The club, however, was celebrating a week later when a draw on the last day of the season ensured survival in Division Two.[18][19] Leicester won the Division Two championship in 1954,[20] with the help of Arthur Rowley, one of the clubs most prolific strikers. Although they were relegated from Division One the next season, under Dave Halliday they returned in 1957,[21] with Rowley scoring a club record 44 goals in one season.[12] Leicester remained in Division One until 1969,[22] their longest period ever in the top flight. Under the management of Matt Gillies and his assistant Bert Johnson, Leicester reached the FA Cup final on another two occasions, but lost in both 1961 and 1963.[3] As they lost to double winners Tottenham Hotspur in 1961, they were Englands representatives in the 196162 European Cup Winners Cup. In the 196263 season, the club led the First Division during the winter, thanks to a sensational run of form on icy and frozen pitches the club became nicknamed the Ice Kings eventually placed fourth, the clubs best post-war finish. Gillies guided Leicester to their first piece of silverware in 1964, when Leicester beat Stoke City 43 on aggregate to win the League Cup for the first time.[3] Leicester also reached the League Cup final the following year, but lost 32 on aggregate to Chelsea. Gillies and Johnson received praise for their version of the whirl and the switch system, a system that had previously been used by the Austrian and Hungarian national teams.[23] After a bad start to the season, Matt Gillies resigned in November 1968. His successor, Frank OFarrell was unable to prevent relegation, but the club reached the FA Cup final in 1969 for the last time to date, losing to Manchester City 10. In 1971, Leicester were promoted back to Division One, and won the Charity Shield for the only time.[3] Unusually, due to double winners Arsenals commitments in European competition, Division Two winners Leicester were invited to play FA Cup runners up Liverpool, beating them 10[3] thanks to a goal by Steve Whitworth.[24] Jimmy Bloomfield was appointed for the new season, and his team remained in the First Division for his tenure. No period since Bloomfield has seen the club remain in the top division for so long. Leicester reached the FA Cup semi-final in 197374.[25] Frank McLintock, a noted player for seven years for Leicester in a successful period from the late Fifties to the mid Sixties, succeeded Jimmy Bloomfield in 1977. City were relegated at the end of the 197778 season and McLintock resigned. Jock Wallace resumed the tradition of successful Scottish managers (after Peter Hodge and Matt Gillies) by steering Leicester to the Division Two championship in 1980.[26] Unfortunately, Wallace was unable to keep Leicester in Division One, but they reached the FA Cup semi-final in 1982. Under Wallace, one of Citys most famous home-grown players, Gary Lineker, emerged into the first team squad. Leicesters next manager was Gordon Milne, who achieved promotion in 1983. Lineker helped Leicester maintain their place in the First Division but was sold to Everton in 1985 and two years later Leicester were relegated, having failed to find a suitable replacement to partner Alan Smith, who was sold to Arsenal after Leicester went down. Milne left in 1986 and was replaced in 1987 by David Pleat, who was sacked in January 1991 with Leicester in danger of relegation to the Third Division. Gordon Lee was put in charge of the club until the end of the season. Leicester won their final game of the season, which guided them clear of relegation to the third tier of the football league.[3] Brian Little took over in 1991 and by the end of the 199192 season Leicester had reached the playoff final for a place in the new FA Premier League, but lost to Blackburn Rovers and a penalty from former Leicester striker Mike Newell. The club also reached the playoff final the following year, losing 43 to Swindon Town, having come back from 30 down. In 199394 City were promoted from the playoffs, beating Derby County 21 in the final.[3] Little quit as Leicester manager the following November to take charge at Aston Villa, and his successor Mark McGhee was unable to save Leicester from finishing second from bottom in the 199495 season. McGhee left the club unexpectedly in December 1995 while Leicester were top of the First Division to take charge of Wolverhampton Wanderers.[27] McGhee was replaced by Martin ONeill.[3] Under ONeill, Leicester qualified for the 1996 Football League play-offs and beat Crystal Palace 21 in the final through a 120th minute Steve Claridge goal to gain promotion to the FA Premier League. Following promotion, Leicester established themselves in the Premier League with four successive top ten finishes. ONeill ended Leicesters 33-year wait for a major trophy, winning the League Cup twice, in 1997 and 2000, and Leicester were runners-up in 1999. Thus the club qualified for the UEFA Cup in 199798 and 200001, the clubs first European competition since 1961. In June 2000, ONeill left Leicester City to take over as manager of Celtic. ONeill was replaced by former England under-21 coach Peter Taylor. During this time, one of Leicesters European appearances ended in a 31 defeat to Red Star Belgrade on 28 September 2000 in the 2001 UEFA Cup.[28] Leicester began well under Taylors management, topping the Premier League for two weeks in the autumn and remaining in contention for a European place for most of the campaign, before a late season collapse dragged them down to a 13th-place finish. Taylor was sacked after a poor start to the 200102 season, and his successor Dave Bassett lasted just six months before being succeeded by his assistant Micky Adams, the change of management being announced just before relegation was confirmed. Leicester won just five league games all season. Leicester moved into the new 32,500-seat Walkers Stadium at the start of the 200203 season, ending 111 years at Filbert Street. Walkers, the Leicestershire-based crisp manufacturers, acquired the naming rights for a ten-year period.[29] In October 2002, the club went into administration with debts of 30million. Some of the reasons were the loss of TV money (ITV Digital, itself in administration, had promised money to First Division clubs for TV rights), the large wage bill, lower than expected fees for players transferred to other clubs and the 37million cost of the new stadium.[30] Adams was banned from the transfer market for most of the season, even after the club was rescued with a takeover by a consortium led by Gary Lineker.[3] Adams guided Leicester to runners-up spot in Division One and automatic promotion back to the Premiership with more than 90 points. Leicester only lasted one season in the top flight and were relegated to the newly labelled Championship, previously known as Division One. When Adams resigned as manager in October 2004 Craig Levein was appointed boss. This would prove to be an unsuccessful period and after 15 months in charge Levein was sacked, having failed to get the Foxes anywhere near the promotion places. Assistant manager Rob Kelly, took over as caretaker manager, and after winning three out of four games was appointed to see out the rest of the season. Kelly steered Leicester to safety and in April 2006 was given the managers job on a permanent basis.[3] In October 2006, ex-Portsmouth chairman Milan Mandari was quoted as saying he was interested in buying the club, reportedly at a price of around 6million with the current playing squad valued at roughly 4.2million. The takeover was formally announced on 13 February 2007.[31] On 11 April 2007, Rob Kelly was sacked as manager and Nigel Worthington appointed as caretaker manager until the end of the season. Worthington saved the club from relegation, but was not offered the job on a permanent basis. On 25 May 2007 the club announced former Milton Keynes Dons manager Martin Allen as their new manager with a three-year contract. Allens relationship with Mandari became tense and after only four games Allen left by mutual consent on 29 August 2007. On 13 September 2007, Mandari announced Gary Megson as the new manager of the club, citing Megsons wealth of experience as a deciding factor in the appointment. Megson, however, left on 24 October 2007 after only six weeks in charge, following an approach made for his services by Bolton Wanderers. Mandari placed Frank Burrows and Gerry Taggart in the shared position as caretaker managers until a professional manager was appointed. On 22 November, Ian Holloway was appointed manager, and he became the first Leicester manager in over 50 years to win his first league game in charge, beating Bristol City 20.[32] This initial success did not last, and Leicester were relegated from the Championship at the end of the 200708 season. 200809 was Leicesters first ever season outside the top two levels of English football, but the appointment of Nigel Pearson to replace Holloway, who left by mutual consent a few weeks after relegation was confirmed, sparked a rebuilding of the club that would culminate in the fastest rise to the peak of the English football league system since Ipswich Town in 1962.[33] Leicester returned to the Championship at the first attempt, finishing as champions of League One after a 20 win at Southend United, with two games in hand. The 200910 season saw Leicesters revival under Pearson continue, as the club finished fifth and reached the Championship play-offs in their first season back in the second tier. Though coming from 20 down on aggregate, away to Cardiff City, to briefly lead 32, they eventually lost to a penalty shoot-out in the play-off semi-final. At the end of the season Pearson left Leicester to become the manager of Hull City, claiming that he felt that the club seemed reluctant to keep him, and that Paulo Sousa had been the clubs guest at both play-off games, hinting at a possible replacement. On 7 July 2010, Sousa was confirmed as Pearsons replacement.[34] In August 2010, following agreement on a three-year shirt sponsorship deal with duty-free retailers the King Power Group, Mandari sold the club to Thai-led consortium Asian Football Investments (AFI) fronted by King Power Groups Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha.[35] Mandari, an investor in AFI,[36] was retained as club chairman.[37] On 1 October 2010, after a poor start that saw Leicester bottom of the Championship with only one win out of the first nine league games, Paulo Sousa was sacked by the club with immediate effect.[38] Two days later, Sven-Gran Eriksson, who had been approached by the club after the 61 loss to then bottom-of-the-table Portsmouth two weeks earlier, was appointed as his replacement, signing a two-year contract with the club.[39] On 10 February 2011, Vichai Raksriaksorn, part of the Thai-based Asia Football Investments consortium, was appointed new chairman of the club after Mandari left in November to take over Sheffield Wednesday.[40] Leicester were viewed as one of the favourites for promotion in the 201112 season, but on 24 October 2011, following an inconsistent start with the Foxes winning just 5 out of their first 13 games, Eriksson left the club by mutual consent.[41] Three weeks later Nigel Pearson returned to the club as Erikssons successor. Pearson would go on to lead the Foxes to a sixth-place finish in the 201213 season, ensuring Leicester were in the Championship play-offs. Leicester, however, lost the playoff semi-final 32 on aggregate to Watford after Anthony Knockaert missed a late penalty and Troy Deeney scored right at the end after a swift counterattack from a Manuel Almunia double save.[42] In 2014, Leicesters march up the league system hit a breakthrough. Their 21 win over Sheffield Wednesday, combined with losses by Queens Park Rangers and Derby County, allowed Leicester City to clinch a promotion to the Premier League after a ten-year absence. Later that month, a win at Bolton saw Leicester become the champions of the 201314 Championship, the seventh time they had been champions of Englands second tier. 5 May 2014 saw 35,000 fans in Leicester line the streets for a parade in celebration of the teams success.[43] Leicester started their first season in the Premier League since 2004 with a good run of results in their first five league games, starting with a 22 draw on the opening day against Everton.[44] The Foxes then claimed their first Premier League win since May 2004, with a 01 win at Stoke City.[45] On 21 September 2014, Leicester went on to produce one of the greatest comebacks in Premier League history to beat Manchester United 53 at the King Power Stadium after coming back from 31 down with 30 minutes left to score four goals. They also made Premier League history by becoming the first team to beat United from a two-goal deficit since the leagues launch in 1992.[46] During the 201415 season, a dismal run of form saw the team slip to the bottom of the league table with only 19 points from 29 games. By 3 April 2015, they were seven points adrift from safety. This could have brought a sudden end to Leicesters seven-year rise, but seven wins from their final nine league games meant that the Foxes finished the season in 14th place with 41 points. They finished the season with a 51 thrashing of relegated Queens Park Rangers. Their upturn in results was described as one of the Premier Leagues greatest ever escapes from relegation.[47][48] They also became only the third team in Premier League history to survive after being bottom at Christmas (the others were West Bromwich Albion in 2005 and Sunderland in 2014), and no team with fewer than 20 points from 29 games had previously stayed up. On 30 June 2015, however, Pearson was sacked, with the club stating that the working relationship between Nigel and the Board is no longer viable. The sacking was linked to a number of PR issues involving Pearson throughout the season, with the final straw involving his son James role in a racist sex tape made by three Leicester reserve players in Thailand during a post-season goodwill tour.[49][50][51] Leicester reacted by appointing former Chelsea manager Claudio Ranieri as their new manager for the new 201516 Premier League season.[52] Under Ranieri, the club made an exceptional start to the season. Striker Jamie Vardy scored 13 goals over 11 consecutive games from August to November, breaking Ruud van Nistelrooys Premier League record of scoring in ten consecutive games.[53] On 19 December, Leicester defeated Everton 32 at Goodison Park to top the Premier League on Christmas Day, having been bottom exactly 12 months earlier.[54] A 20 victory at Sunderland on 10 April, coupled with Tottenhams 30 win over Manchester United, ensured Leicesters qualification for the UEFA Champions League for the first time in their history.[55]  Leicester won the Premier League on 2 May 2016 after Tottenham failed to secure a win against Chelsea, drawing 22 at the Battle of Stamford Bridge.[57][58] This completed the fastest seven-year rise to the title except for Ipswich Town in 1962, and Leicester faced a far more unequal top tier than Ipswich did back then.[33][59] Bookmakers thought Leicesters victory was so unlikely that Ladbrokes and William Hill offered odds of 5,0001 for it at the start of the season. Neither bookmaker had ever paid out such long odds, and the trophy resulted in the largest payout in British sporting history with total winnings of 25million.[60][61][62] The scale of the surprise attracted global attention for the club and the city of Leicester.[63][64] The Economist declared it would be pored over for management lessons.[65] Several commentators have viewed it as an inspiration to other clubs and fundamentally transforming the expectations similar sized clubs face in English football.[66] Ranieris Leicester became known for their counter attacking style of play, incredible pace in the areas it is most essential and defensive solidarity.[67] Players were often praised for their work ethic and togetherness which was apparent throughout the squad. On 16 May 2016, over 240,000 Leicester City fans turned out on the streets of Leicester and Victoria Park to celebrate their teams historic achievement.[68] Reacting to City winning the Premier League, Executive Chairman Richard Scudamore said: A film has even been planned of the story, centred on Jamie Vardy.[69] Just ahead of the opening match of the 201617 season, Ranieri cautioned against excessive hope of City retaining the title arguing that the other clubs now understood Leicesters break tactics. His principle objective, as last season, was to avoid relegation. He also warned against overconfidence against relegation favourites  by implication their next opponents newly promoted Hull City.[70] His view on Leicesters chances were shared by Gary Lineker, who said that NGolo Kant, who left the club during the summer to join Chelsea, had been Leicesters most important player and essential to Ranieris system.[71] Leicester initially struggled in their domestic form during 201617, spending much of the first few months in the bottom half of the table. In December 2016, Ranieri was awarded coach of the year and Leicester team of the year at the BBC Sports Personality of the Year.[72] On 23 February 2017, however, Ranieri was sacked due to the clubs continuing poor form, resulting in them being only one point above the relegation zone. Gary Lineker called the sacking very sad and inexplicable,[73] while Manchester United manager Jos Mourinho blamed it on selfish players.[73] Rumours began emerging some days later that players had been meeting with the owners to discuss Ranieris sacking without Ranieri knowing, which sparked widespread outrage over social media.[74] Commenting on the collapse in form of the team and particularly Jamie Vardy during the first 20 matches of the 201617 season, Alan Shearer said Vardy had signed a bumper new contract, but was no longer doing what brought him success last season, and that the entire club was no longer doing the basics.[75] Less than a week after Ranieri was sacked, Craig Shakespeare took over as caretaker manager, and in his first match in charge Leicester won 31 against fifth-placed Liverpool, with Vardy scoring a brace.[76] In his second game as caretaker, Shakespeare led Leicester to another 31 victory, over Hull City.[77] Following two impressive results and initiating the type of positive response that we hoped change would bring, the clubs owners then decided Shakespeare would become the clubs manager until the end of the season.[78] The 201617 campaign was also the first season in 15 years that Leicester qualified for European football. Leicester were placed in Group G of the UEFA Champions League alongside Porto, Copenhagen and Club Brugge. In their inaugural Champions League campaign, they went undefeated in their first five matches to progress to the knock-out stages as group winners.[79] The Foxes then faced La Liga club Sevilla in the round of 16 and defeated the Spanish side 20 on the night, and 32 on aggregate to advance to the quarter-finals.[80] In the quarter-finals, they faced Atltico Madrid, and drew 11 on the night, but lost 12 on aggregate after losing 10 in the first leg. This subsequently put an end to Leicester Citys 20162017 European campaign, as they finished as UEFA Champions League quarter-finalists.[81] The clubs home colours of royal blue shirts, white shorts, and royal blue socks have been used for the teams kits throughout most of its history.[82] The first sponsorship logo to appear on a Leicester shirt was that of Ind Coope in 1983. British snack food manufacturer Walkers Crisps held a long association with the club, sponsoring them from 1987 to 2001. The club have three main nicknames  The Foxes, The Blues and City. The Foxes is the most common nickname for the club, whereas The Blues and City are local terms, usually used by the supporters. Other names include The Filberts and The Fossils.[83] An image of a fox was first incorporated into the club crest in 1948, as Leicestershire is known for foxes and fox hunting.[84] This is the origin of the nickname The Foxes. The club mascot is a character called Filbert Fox. There are also secondary characters Vickie Vixen and Cousin Dennis. Since 1992, the clubs badge has featured a foxs head overlaid onto a Cinquefoil; the Cinquefoil is similar to the one used on the coat of arms of Leicester. Prior to 1992, the clubs badge had a range of designs. In the 200910 season, the clubs 125th anniversary year, the home kit featured no sponsor and a new central crest with 125 Years written beneath it. Following this year, the clubs crest was reverted back again but with some changes which are reflected in the design of the current badge. The alterations included the fox in the crest having a white area under its nose, and more spacing between the letters. The football based circles either side of the crest were also removed.[85] In 1941, the club adopted the playing of the Post Horn Galop prior to home matches.[86] It was played over the PA system as the teams came out of the tunnel at all home games. The club since replaced it with a modern version, which is now played as teams emerge for the second half. For the first half, the post horn has been played live on pitch by Paul Hing since 2009.[87] Foxes Never Quit is the clubs motto, which is placed above the tunnel entrance as the teams head out onto the pitch. 8 July 2016 saw the club launch their new third away kit for the 201617 Premier League season. It will feature in their 201617 UEFA Champions League campaign, and will also be in use for Leicesters debut match in the competition. The design took inspiration from the 198384 kit, and boasts a clean white design with thin blue pinstripes on the shirt, as well as a textured form stripe design across both the shirt and shorts. Since 2012, Leicester Citys kit has been manufactured by Puma.[88] Previous manufacturers have included Bukta (196264, 199092), Admiral (197679, 198388), Umbro (197983), Scoreline (198890), Fox Leisure (19922000), Le Coq Sportif (200005), JJB (200507), Jako (200709), Joma (200910), and BURRDA (201012).[89] The current shirt sponsors are King Power, a company also owned by the clubs owners. The first sponsorship logo to appear on a Leicester shirt was that of Ind Coope in 1983. British snack food manufacturer Walkers Crisps held a long association with the club, sponsoring them from 1987 to 2001. Other sponsors have included John Bull (198687), LG (200103), Alliance & Leicester (200307), Topps Tiles (200709), Jessops (200910), and Loros (200910). In their early years, Leicester played at numerous grounds, but have only played at two since they joined the Football League. When first starting out they played on a field by the Fosse Road,[90] hence the original name Leicester Fosse. They moved from there to Victoria Park, and subsequently to Belgrave Road. Upon turning professional the club moved to Mill Lane.[90] After eviction from Mill Lane the club played at the County Cricket ground while seeking a new ground. The club secured the use of an area of ground by Filbert Street, and moved there in 1891.[90] Some improvements by noted football architect Archibald Leitch occurred in the Edwardian era, and in 1927 a new two tier stand was built,[90] named the Double Decker, a name it would keep till the grounds closure in 2002. The ground wasnt developed any further, apart from compulsory seating being added, till 1993 when work began on the new Carling Stand. The stand was impressive while the rest of the ground was untouched since at least the 1920s; this led manager Martin ONeill to say he used to lead new signings out backwards so they only saw the Carling Stand.[91] The club moved away from Filbert Street in 2002 to a new 32,500 all-seater stadium.[92] The stadium was originally named The Walkers Stadium in a deal with food manufacturers Walkers, whose brand logo can still be found in some areas around the outside of the stadium.[93] The first match the Walkers hosted was a friendly against Athletic Bilbao, the game was drawn 11 with Tiko of Bilbao being the first scorer at the stadium and Jordan Stewart being the first City player to score,[94] and the first competitive match was a 20 victory against Watford.[95] The stadium has since hosted an England international against Serbia and Montenegro which finished 21 to England, as well as internationals between Brazil and Jamaica, and Jamaica and Ghana. The stadium has been used to host the Heineken Cup European Rugby semi-finals for the Leicester Tigers rugby club, itself based within a mile of the King Power Stadium. On 19 August 2010, it emerged that the new owners King Power wanted to rename the stadium The King Power Stadium, and had plans to increase the capacity to 42,000 should Leicester secure promotion.[96] On 7 July 2011, Leicester City confirmed that the Walkers Stadium would now be known as the King Power Stadium. In 2015, vice-chairman Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha stated that plans were in place to increase the capacity of the stadium to around 42,000.[97] Relocation to a bigger stadium has also been considered.[98] The King Power Stadium has also honoured past greats of the club, by naming suites and lounges inside the stadium after the clubs former players Gordon Banks, Adam Black, Arthur Chandler, Gary Lineker, Arthur Rowley, Sep Smith, Keith Weller and former manager Jimmy Bloomfield.[99] The clubs associated song is When Youre Smiling, and the supporters are often referred to as the Blue Army. According to Football League crowd statistics between the 200910 and 201314 seasons, in each campaign the club were in the top five (out of all three Football League divisions) for their home & away attendances. Since 2010, their biggest away following was at an FA Cup match against Nottingham Forest at the City Ground in 2012; 8,000 travelling Foxes fans went to the match, with the scoreline finishing 00.[100] At home matches, Leicester have gained notability for their passionate crowd and vocal atmosphere.[101][102] Since City moved to their new stadium in 2002 following the exit of Filbert Street, average home gates have never dropped below 20,000, even when they were relegated to League One in 2008 for the first time in the clubs history. The club have several supporter groups in England,[103] and alongside the support in the UK, Leicester City also have fans around the world. Since being bought by the King Power group in 2011, Leicester have developed a following in Thailand, the home of their owners.[104] In Algeria, Leicester have gained support due to Algerian pair Riyad Mahrez and Islam Slimani playing for the club. In Thailand, Singha Corporation is an Official Club Partner. The club also have supporters in New York.[105][106][107] Leicester City supporters share good relations with fans of European teams VfL Bochum and Anderlecht. Regularly supporters travel over to Europe to support these two teams, and vice versa.[108] Some Leicester fans consider Nottingham Forest to be their main rivals. The clubs other rivals are Derby County. An East Midlands Derby is any match involving two of these three clubs.[109] Leicester also have a rivalry with Coventry City, 24miles away. The game between the two clubs has become known as the M69 derby, named after the M69 motorway which connects the two cities together.[110] Up until Peter Hodge was hired after World War I, the club had no official manager. A nominal role of secretary/manager was employed, though the board and the selection committee took control of most team affairs. It was Hodge who instated a system at the club for the manager having complete control over player and staff recruitment, team selection and tactics. Though Hodge was originally also titled secretary/manager he has retrospectively been named as the clubs first official manager.[112] Leicester have had a total of nine permanent secretary/managers and 35 permanent managers (not including caretakers). Nigel Pearson and Peter Hodge have both had two separate spells in charge the club. Dave Bassett also had a second spell as caretaker manager after his spell as permanent manager.[113] Graham Cross holds the record for the most Leicester appearances, with the defender playing 599 games between 19601976, although Adam Black holds the record for the most appearances in the league with 528 between 19201935.[114] Striker Arthur Chandler is currently the clubs all-time record goal scorer, netting 273 in his 12 years at the club; he also found the net in 8 consecutive matches in the 192425 season.[9] The most goals managed in a single season for the club is 44 by Arthur Rowley, in the 195657 season.[9] The fastest goal in the clubs history was scored by Matty Fryatt, when he netted after just nine seconds against Preston North End in April 2006.[115] Jamie Vardy broke the Premier League record for scoring 11 goals in 11 consecutive league games, in the 201516 Premier League season. Vardy is also the ninth player to score 20 top-flight goals in a season, following Arthur Chandler, Ernie Hine, Arthur Rowley, Jimmy Walsh, Ken Keyworth, Jackie Sinclair, Frank Worthington and Gary Lineker. Vardys goal at Sunderland on 10 April 2016 saw him become the first player since Gary Lineker in 198485 to score 20 top flight goals for the Club, having already become Leicesters highest Premier League scorer in a single season.[116] The record transfer fee paid by Leicester for a player was around 29million for Sporting CP striker Islam Slimani. The highest transfer fee received for a Leicester player was approximately 30million from Chelsea for midfielder NGolo Kant.[117] The clubs record attendance is 47,298 against Tottenham Hotspur at Filbert Street, in a fifth round FA Cup clash in 1928. The highest league record at their current home, the King Power Stadium, was 32,242 for a competitive match against Sunderland on 8 August 2015. The highest ever attendance for a non-competitive Football game of 32,188, was seen at a pre-season friendly against Spanish giants Real Madrid on 30 July 2011.[118] Leicesters highest ever league finish is first in the Premier League in 201516. Their lowest ever league finish was first in League One in 200809. Leicester are joint equal with Manchester City for having won the most English second tier titles (7). The club has reached four FA Cup finals, yet lost them all.[9] This is the record for the most FA Cup final appearances without winning the trophy. Leicesters longest ever unbeaten run in the league was between 1 November 2008 and 7 March 2009, to which they remained unbeaten for 23 games on their way to the League One title.[119] (This was their only ever season in the third tier of English football). Their longest run of consecutive victories in the league is nine, which they achieved between 21 December 2013 and 1 February 2014 (in the Championship). In the 201516 season, Leicester won what The Daily Telegraph described as one of the most astonishing league titles of all-time[120] and achieved many new historical, club records. They had the fewest away defeats in any top flight season, as they were defeated only twice on their travels. They also recorded the fewest losses in any of the clubs Premier League seasons, losing just three matches throughout their entire campaign. The club produced another record for the most consecutive wins in the top flight, each coming against Watford, Newcastle United, Crystal Palace, Southampton and Sunderland. Coincidentally, they kept a record of five-straight clean sheets all set against each of the same five opponents. The King Power Stadium home crowd in 201516 saw City beaten just once in the Premier League all season.[116] Leicester made their UEFA Champions League debut in the 201617 season, their fourth appearance in European football. The club became the third English team to win on their Champions League debut, after Manchester United in 1994 and Newcastle United in 1997. They are also the first English team to win away on their Champions League debut, and win all three of their opening games in the competition.[121][122] They are the first team in Champions League history to keep clean sheets in each of their opening four games in the competition.[123] Between September 2015 and November 2016, Leicester went 20 league games unbeaten at home. The stint was ended by West Bromwich Albion on 6 November 2016 in a 12 defeat.[124][125] In March 2017, the club became the 50th team to reach the Champions League quarter-finals. Since their election to the Football League in 1894, Leicester have spent much of their history within the top two tiers of English football. Leicester have played outside the top two tiers only once in their history to date; during the 200809 season they played in League One, the third tier of English football, after relegation from the Championship the season prior. However, they made a swift return to the second tier, as they were promoted as champions in the 200809 season. The club have never played lower than Englands third tier.

England, that competes in the Premier League, the top flight of English football. Nicknamed the Red Devils, the club was founded as Newton Heath LYR Football Club in 1878, changed its name to Manchester United in 1902 and moved to its current stadium, Old Trafford, in 1910. Manchester United are the most successful club in England, having won a record 20 League Titles, 12 FA Cups, 5 League Cups and a record 21 FA Community Shields. The club has also won three UEFA Champions Leagues, one UEFA Europa League, one UEFA Cup Winners Cup, one UEFA Super Cup, one Intercontinental Cup and one FIFA Club World Cup. In 199899, the club became the first in the history of English football to achieve the treble of the Premier League, the FA Cup and the UEFA Champions League.[3] In 201617, they also, by winning the UEFA Europa League, became one of five clubs to have won all three main UEFA club competitions. In winning all three top domestic trophies (as well as both iterations of the English championship), all three major European trophies, both the domestic and European super cups, and the only British club to have won both international titles (the now-defunct Intercontinental Cup in 1999 and its successor, the FIFA World Club Cup in 2008), the club has achieved a clean sweep of all top honours available to it; the first and thus far only English club to do so.[4] The 1958 Munich air disaster claimed the lives of eight players. In 1968, under the management of Matt Busby, Manchester United became the first English football club to win the European Cup. Alex Ferguson won 38 trophies as manager, including 13 Premier League titles, 5 FA Cups and 2 UEFA Champions Leagues, between 1986 and 2013,[5][6][7] when he announced his retirement. Jos Mourinho is the clubs current manager, having been appointed on 27 May 2016. Manchester United was the highest-earning football club in the world for 201516, with an annual revenue of 689million,[8] and the worlds most valuable football club in 2017, valued at 2.86billion.[9] As of June 2015, it is the worlds most valuable football brand, estimated to be worth $1.2billion.[10][11] After being floated on the London Stock Exchange in 1991, the club was purchased by Malcolm Glazer in May 2005 in a deal valuing the club at almost 800million, after which the company was taken private again, before going public once more in August 2012, when they made an initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange. Manchester United is one of the most widely supported football clubs in the world,[12][13] and holds several rivalries with other clubs, most notably with Liverpool, Manchester City and Leeds United, and more recently with Arsenal. Manchester United was formed in 1878 as Newton Heath LYR Football Club by the Carriage and Wagon department of the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway (LYR) depot at Newton Heath.[14] The team initially played games against other departments and railway companies, but on 20 November 1880, they competed in their first recorded match; wearing the colours of the railway company  green and gold  they were defeated 60 by Bolton Wanderers reserve team.[15] By 1888, the club had become a founding member of The Combination, a regional football league. Following the leagues dissolution after only one season, Newton Heath joined the newly formed Football Alliance, which ran for three seasons before being merged with the Football League. This resulted in the club starting the 189293 season in the First Division, by which time it had become independent of the railway company and dropped the LYR from its name.[14] After two seasons, the club was relegated to the Second Division.[14] In January 1902, with debts of 2,670  equivalent to 260,000 in 2017[nb 1]  the club was served with a winding-up order.[16] Captain Harry Stafford found four local businessmen, including John Henry Davies (who became club president), each willing to invest 500 in return for a direct interest in running the club and who subsequently changed the name;[17] on 24 April 1902, Manchester United was officially born.[18][nb 2] Under Ernest Mangnall, who assumed managerial duties in 1903, the team finished as Second Division runners-up in 1906 and secured promotion to the First Division, which they won in 1908  the clubs first league title. The following season began with victory in the first ever Charity Shield[19] and ended with the clubs first FA Cup title. Manchester United won the First Division for the second time in 1911, but at the end of the following season, Mangnall left the club to join Manchester City.[20] In 1922, three years after the resumption of football following the First World War, the club was relegated to the Second Division, where it remained until regaining promotion in 1925. Relegated again in 1931, Manchester United became a yo-yo club, achieving its all-time lowest position of 20th place in the Second Division in 1934. Following the death of principal benefactor John Henry Davies in October 1927, the clubs finances deteriorated to the extent that Manchester United would likely have gone bankrupt had it not been for James W. Gibson, who, in December 1931, invested 2,000 and assumed control of the club.[21] In the 193839 season, the last year of football before the Second World War, the club finished 14th in the First Division.[21] In October 1945, the impending resumption of football led to the managerial appointment of Matt Busby, who demanded an unprecedented level of control over team selection, player transfers and training sessions.[22] Busby led the team to second-place league finishes in 1947, 1948 and 1949, and to FA Cup victory in 1948. In 1952, the club won the First Division, its first league title for 41 years.[23] With an average age of 22, the back-to-back title winning side of 1956 were labelled the Busby Babes by the media, a testament to Busbys faith in his youth players.[24] In 1957, Manchester United became the first English team to compete in the European Cup, despite objections from The Football League, who had denied Chelsea the same opportunity the previous season.[25] En route to the semi-final, which they lost to Real Madrid, the team recorded a 100 victory over Belgian champions Anderlecht, which remains the clubs biggest victory on record.[26] The following season, on the way home from a European Cup quarter-final victory against Red Star Belgrade, the aircraft carrying the Manchester United players, officials and journalists crashed while attempting to take off after refuelling in Munich, Germany. The Munich air disaster of 6 February 1958 claimed 23 lives, including those of eight players Geoff Bent, Roger Byrne, Eddie Colman, Duncan Edwards, Mark Jones, David Pegg, Tommy Taylor and Billy Whelan and injured several more.[27][28] Reserve team manager Jimmy Murphy took over as manager while Busby recovered from his injuries and the clubs makeshift side reached the FA Cup final, which they lost to Bolton Wanderers. In recognition of the teams tragedy, UEFA invited the club to compete in the 195859 European Cup alongside eventual League champions Wolverhampton Wanderers. Despite approval from the FA, the Football League determined that the club should not enter the competition, since it had not qualified.[29][30] Busby rebuilt the team through the 1960s by signing players such as Denis Law and Pat Crerand, who combined with the next generation of youth players  including George Best  to win the FA Cup in 1963. The following season, they finished second in the league, then won the title in 1965 and 1967. In 1968, Manchester United became the first English (and second British) club to win the European Cup, beating Benfica 41 in the final[31] with a team that contained three European Footballers of the Year: Bobby Charlton, Denis Law and George Best.[32] Matt Busby resigned as manager in 1969 and was replaced by the reserve team coach, former Manchester United player Wilf McGuinness.[33] Following an eighth-place finish in the 196970 season and a poor start to the 197071 season, Busby was persuaded to temporarily resume managerial duties, and McGuinness returned to his position as reserve team coach. In June 1971, Frank OFarrell was appointed as manager, but lasted less than 18months before being replaced by Tommy Docherty in December 1972.[35] Docherty saved Manchester United from relegation that season, only to see them relegated in 1974; by that time the trio of Best, Law, and Charlton had left the club.[31] The team won promotion at the first attempt and reached the FA Cup final in 1976, but were beaten by Southampton. They reached the final again in 1977, beating Liverpool 21. Docherty was dismissed shortly afterwards, following the revelation of his affair with the club physiotherapists wife.[33][36] Dave Sexton replaced Docherty as manager in the summer of 1977. Despite major signings, including Joe Jordan, Gordon McQueen, Gary Bailey, and Ray Wilkins, the team failed to achieve any significant results; they finished in the top two in 197980 and lost to Arsenal in the 1979 FA Cup Final. Sexton was dismissed in 1981, even though the team won the last seven games under his direction.[37] He was replaced by Ron Atkinson, who immediately broke the British record transfer fee to sign Bryan Robson from West Bromwich Albion. Under Atkinson, Manchester United won the FA Cup twice in three years  in 1983 and 1985. In 198586, after 13 wins and two draws in its first 15 matches, the club was favourite to win the league, but finished in fourth place. The following season, with the club in danger of relegation by November, Atkinson was dismissed.[38] Alex Ferguson and his assistant Archie Knox arrived from Aberdeen on the day of Atkinsons dismissal,[39] and guided the club to an 11th-place finish in the league.[40] Despite a second-place finish in 198788, the club was back in 11th place the following season.[41] Reportedly on the verge of being dismissed, victory over Crystal Palace in the 1990 FA Cup Final replay (after a 33 draw) saved Fergusons career.[42][43] The following season, Manchester United claimed its first Cup Winners Cup title and competed in the 1991 UEFA Super Cup, beating European Cup holders Red Star Belgrade 10 in the final at Old Trafford. A second consecutive League Cup final appearance followed in 1992, in which the team beat Nottingham Forest 10 at Wembley.[38] In 1993, the club won its first league title since 1967, and a year later, for the first time since 1957, it won a second consecutive title  alongside the FA Cup  to complete the first Double in the clubs history.[38] In the 199899 season, Manchester United became the first team to win the Premier League, FA Cup and UEFA Champions League  The Treble  in the same season.[45] Losing 10 going into injury time in the 1999 UEFA Champions League Final, Teddy Sheringham and Ole Gunnar Solskjr scored late goals to claim a dramatic victory over Bayern Munich, in what is considered one of the greatest comebacks of all time.[46] The club also won the Intercontinental Cup after beating Palmeiras 10 in Tokyo.[47] Ferguson was subsequently knighted for his services to football.[48] Manchester United won the league again in the 19992000 and 200001 seasons. The team finished third in 200102, before regaining the title in 200203.[49] They won the 200304 FA Cup, beating Millwall 30 in the final at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff to lift the trophy for a record 11th time.[50] In the 200506 season, Manchester United failed to qualify for the knockout phase of the UEFA Champions League for the first time in over a decade,[51] but recovered to secure a second-place league finish and victory over Wigan Athletic in the 2006 Football League Cup Final. The club regained the Premier League in the 200607 and 200708 seasons, and completed the European double by beating Chelsea 65 on penalties in the 2008 UEFA Champions League Final in Moscows Luzhniki Stadium. Ryan Giggs made a record 759th appearance for the club in this game, overtaking previous record holder Bobby Charlton.[52] In December 2008, the club won the 2008 FIFA Club World Cup and followed this with the 200809 Football League Cup, and its third successive Premier League title.[53][54] That summer, Cristiano Ronaldo was sold to Real Madrid for a world record 80million.[55] In 2010, Manchester United defeated Aston Villa 21 at Wembley to retain the League Cup, its first successful defence of a knockout cup competition.[56] After finishing as runner-up to Chelsea in the 200910 season, United achieved a record 19th league title in 201011, securing the championship with a 11 away draw against Blackburn Rovers on 14 May 2011.[57] This was extended to 20 league titles in 201213, securing the championship with a 30 home win against Aston Villa on 22 April 2013.[58] On 8 May 2013, Ferguson announced that he was to retire as manager at the end of the football season, but would remain at the club as a director and club ambassador.[59][60] The club announced the next day that Everton manager David Moyes would replace him from 1 July, having signed a six-year contract.[61][62][63] Ryan Giggs took over as interim player-manager 10 months later, on 22 April 2014, when Moyes was sacked after a poor season in which the club failed to defend their Premier League title and failed to qualify for the UEFA Champions League for the first time since 199596.[64] They also failed to qualify for the Europa League, meaning that it was the first time Manchester United hadnt qualified for a European competition since 1990.[65] On 19 May 2014, it was confirmed that Louis van Gaal would replace Moyes as Manchester United manager on a three-year deal, with Giggs as his assistant.[66] Malcolm Glazer, the patriarch of the Glazer family that owns the club, died on 28 May 2014.[67] Although Van Gaals first season saw United once again qualify for the Champions League through a fourth-place finish in the Premier League, his second season saw United go out of the same tournament in the group stage.[68] United also fell behind in the title race for the third consecutive season, finishing in 5th place, in spite of several expensive signings during Van Gaals tenure. However, that same season, Manchester United won the FA Cup for a 12th time.[69] Despite this victory, Van Gaal was sacked as manager just two days later,[70] with Jos Mourinho appointed in his place on 27 May, signing a three-year contract.[71] The club crest is derived from the Manchester City Council coat of arms, although all that remains of it on the current crest is the ship in full sail.[72] The devil stems from the clubs nickname The Red Devils; it was included on club programmes and scarves in the 1960s, and incorporated into the club crest in 1970, although the crest was not included on the chest of the shirt until 1971 (unless the team was playing in a Cup Final).[72] Newton Heaths uniform in 1879, four years before the club played its first competitive match, has been documented as white with blue cord.[73] A photograph of the Newton Heath team, taken in 1892, is believed to show the players wearing red-and-white quartered jerseys and navy blue knickerbockers.[74] Between 189496, the players wore distinctive green and gold jerseys[74] which were replaced in 1896 by white shirts, which were worn with navy blue shorts.[74] After the name change in 1902, the club colours were changed to red shirts, white shorts, and black socks, which has become the standard Manchester United home kit.[74] Very few changes were made to the kit until 1922 when the club adopted white shirts bearing a deep red V around the neck, similar to the shirt worn in the 1909 FA Cup Final. They remained part of their home kits until 1927.[74] For a period in 1934, the cherry and white hooped change shirt became the home colours, but the following season the red shirt was recalled after the clubs lowest ever league placing of 20th in the Second Division and the hooped shirt dropped back to being the change.[74] The black socks were changed to white from 1959 to 1965, where they were replaced with red socks up until 1971, when the club reverted to black. Black shorts and/or white socks are sometimes worn with the home strip, most often in away games, if there is a clash with the opponents kit. Since 199798, white socks have been the preferred choice for European games to aid with player visibility.[75] The current home kit is a two-tone halved shirt in two shades of red, with a hexagonal pattern dividing the two shades, and the trademark Adidas three stripes in white going each side of the torso.[76] The Manchester United away strip has often been a white shirt, black shorts and white socks, but there have been several exceptions. These include an all-black strip with blue and gold trimmings between 1993 and 1995, the navy blue shirt with silver horizontal pinstripes worn during the 19992000 season,[77] and the 201112 away kit, which had a royal blue body and sleeves with hoops made of small midnight navy blue and black stripes, with black shorts and blue socks.[78] An all-grey away kit worn during the 199596 season was dropped after just five games, most notoriously against Southampton where Alex Ferguson forced the team to change into the third kit during half-time of its final outing. The reason for dropping it being that the players claimed to have trouble finding their teammates against the crowd, United failed to win a competitive game in the kit.[79] In 2001, to celebrate 100 years as Manchester United, a reversible white/gold away kit was released, although the actual match day shirts were not reversible.[80] The clubs third kit is often all-blue, this was most recently the case during the 201415 season.[81] Exceptions include a green-and-gold halved shirt worn between 1992 and 1994, a blue-and-white striped shirt worn during the 199495 and 199596 seasons and once in 199697, an all-black kit worn during the Treble-winning 199899 season, and a white shirt with black-and-red horizontal pinstripes worn between 200304 and 200506.[82] From 200607 to 201314, the third kit was the previous seasons away kit, albeit updated with the new club sponsor in 200607 and 201011, apart from 200809 when an all-blue kit was launch to mark the 40th anniversary of the 196768 European Cup success.[83] Newton Heath initially played on a field on North Road, close to the railway yard; the original capacity was about 12,000, but club officials deemed the facilities inadequate for a club hoping to join The Football League.[84] Some expansion took place in 1887, and in 1891, Newton Heath used its minimal financial reserves to purchase two grandstands, each able to hold 1,000 spectators.[85] Although attendances were not recorded for many of the earliest matches at North Road, the highest documented attendance was approximately 15,000 for a First Division match against Sunderland on 4 March 1893.[86] A similar attendance was also recorded for a friendly match against Gorton Villa on 5 September 1889.[87] In June 1893, after the club was evicted from North Road by its owners, Manchester Deans and Canons, who felt it was inappropriate for the club to charge an entry fee to the ground, secretary A. H. Albut procured the use of the Bank Street ground in Clayton.[88] It initially had no stands, by the start of the 189394 season, two had been built; one spanning the full length of the pitch on one side and the other behind the goal at the Bradford end. At the opposite end, the Clayton end, the ground had been built up, thousands thus being provided for.[88] Newton Heaths first league match at Bank Street was played against Burnley on 1 September 1893, when 10,000 people saw Alf Farman score a hat-trick, Newton Heaths only goals in a 32 win. The remaining stands were completed for the following league game against Nottingham Forest three weeks later.[88] In October 1895, before the visit of Manchester City, the club purchased a 2,000-capacity stand from the Broughton Rangers rugby league club, and put up another stand on the reserved side (as distinct from the popular side). However, weather restricted the attendance for the Manchester City match to just 12,000.[89] When the Bank Street ground was temporarily closed by bailiffs in 1902, club captain Harry Stafford raised enough money to pay for the clubs next away game at Bristol City and found a temporary ground at Harpurhey for the next reserves game against Padiham.[90] Following financial investment, new club president John Henry Davies paid 500 for the erection of a new 1,000-seat stand at Bank Street.[91] Within four years, the stadium had cover on all four sides, as well as the ability to hold approximately 50,000 spectators, some of whom could watch from the viewing gallery atop the Main Stand.[91] However, following Manchester Uniteds first league title in 1908 and the FA Cup a year later, it was decided that Bank Street was too restrictive for Davies ambition;[91] in February 1909, six weeks before the clubs first FA Cup title, Old Trafford was named as the home of Manchester United, following the purchase of land for around 60,000. Architect Archibald Leitch was given a budget of 30,000 for construction; original plans called for seating capacity of 100,000, though budget constraints forced a revision to 77,000. The building was constructed by Messrs Brameld and Smith of Manchester. The stadiums record attendance was registered on 25 March 1939, when an FA Cup semi-final between Wolverhampton Wanderers and Grimsby Town drew 76,962spectators.[92] Bombing in the Second World War destroyed much of the stadium; the central tunnel in the South Stand was all that remained of that quarter. After the war, the club received compensation from the War Damage Commission in the amount of 22,278. While reconstruction took place, the team played its home games at Manchester Citys Maine Road ground; Manchester United was charged 5,000 per year, plus a nominal percentage of gate receipts.[93] Later improvements included the addition of roofs, first to the Stretford End and then to the North and East Stands. The roofs were supported by pillars that obstructed many fans views, and they were eventually replaced with a cantilevered structure. The Stretford End was the last stand to receive a cantilevered roof, completed in time for the 199394 season.[33] First used on 25 March 1957 and costing 40,000, four 180-foot (55m) pylons were erected, each housing 54individual floodlights. These were dismantled in 1987 and replaced by a lighting system embedded in the roof of each stand, which remains in use today.[94] The Taylor Reports requirement for an all-seater stadium lowered capacity at Old Trafford to around 44,000 by 1993. In 1995, the North Stand was redeveloped into three tiers, restoring capacity to approximately 55,000. At the end of the 199899 season, second tiers were added to the East and West Stands, raising capacity to around 67,000, and between July 2005 and May 2006, 8,000 more seats were added via second tiers in the north-west and north-east quadrants. Part of the new seating was used for the first time on 26 March 2006, when an attendance of 69,070 became a new Premier League record.[95] The record was pushed steadily upwards before reaching its peak on 31 March 2007, when 76,098 spectators saw Manchester United beat Blackburn Rovers 41, with just 114 seats (0.15percent of the total capacity of 76,212) unoccupied.[96] In 2009, reorganisation of the seating resulted in a reduction of capacity by 255 to 75,957.[97][98] Manchester United has the second highest average attendance of European football clubs only behind Borussia Dortmund.[99][100][101] Manchester United is one of the most popular football clubs in the world, with one of the highest average home attendance in Europe.[102] The club states that its worldwide fan base includes more than 200 officially recognised branches of the Manchester United Supporters Club (MUSC), in at least 24 countries.[103] The club takes advantage of this support through its worldwide summer tours. Accountancy firm and sports industry consultants Deloitte estimate that Manchester United has 75million fans worldwide,[12] while other estimates put this figure closer to 333million.[104] The club has the third highest social media following in the world among sports teams (after Barcelona and Real Madrid), with over 71 million Facebook fans as of September 2016.[13][105] A 2014 study showed that Manchester United had the loudest fans in the Premier League.[106] Supporters are represented by two independent bodies; the Independent Manchester United Supporters Association (IMUSA), which maintains close links to the club through the MUFC Fans Forum,[107] and the Manchester United Supporters Trust (MUST). After the Glazer familys takeover in 2005, a group of fans formed a splinter club, F.C. United of Manchester. The West Stand of Old Trafford  the Stretford End  is the home end and the traditional source of the clubs most vocal support.[108] Manchester United has rivalries with Arsenal, Leeds United, Liverpool, and Manchester City, against whom they contest the Manchester derby.[109][110] The rivalry with Liverpool is rooted in competition between the cities during the Industrial Revolution when Manchester was famous for its textile industry while Liverpool was a major port.[111] Manchester United and Liverpool are also the two most successful teams in England and, at many points in their history, they have battled each other for the league title (most recently in the 200809 season). Their matches are usually considered by the players and their fans as the biggest in any given season. The Roses Rivalry with Leeds stems from the Wars of the Roses, fought between the House of Lancaster and the House of York, with Manchester United representing Lancashire and Leeds representing Yorkshire.[112] The rivalry with Arsenal arises from the numerous times the two teams, as well as managers Alex Ferguson and Arsne Wenger, have battled for the Premier League title. With 33 titles between them (20 for Manchester United, 13 for Arsenal) this fixture has become known as one of the finest Premier League match-ups in history.[113][114] Manchester United has been described as a global brand; a 2011 report by Brand Finance, valued the clubs trademarks and associated intellectual property at 412million  an increase of 39million on the previous year, valuing it at 11million more than the second best brand, Real Madrid  and gave the brand a strength rating of AAA (Extremely Strong).[115] In July 2012, Manchester United was ranked first by Forbes magazine in its list of the ten most valuable sports team brands, valuing the Manchester United brand at $2.23billion.[116] The club is ranked third in the Deloitte Football Money League (behind Real Madrid and Barcelona).[117] In January 2013, the club became the first sports team in the world to be valued at $3billion. Forbes Magazine valued the club at $3.3billion  $1.2billion higher than the next most valuable sports team.[118] The core strength of Manchester Uniteds global brand is often attributed to Matt Busbys rebuilding of the team and subsequent success following the Munich air disaster, which drew worldwide acclaim.[108] The iconic team included Bobby Charlton and Nobby Stiles (members of Englands World Cup winning team), Denis Law and George Best. The attacking style of play adopted by this team (in contrast to the defensive-minded catenaccio approach favoured by the leading Italian teams of the era) captured the imagination of the English footballing public.[119] Busbys team also became associated with the liberalisation of Western society during the 1960s; George Best, known as the Fifth Beatle for his iconic haircut, was the first footballer to significantly develop an off-the-field media profile.[119] As the second English football club to float on the London Stock Exchange in 1991, the club raised significant capital, with which it further developed its commercial strategy. The clubs focus on commercial and sporting success brought significant profits in an industry often characterised by chronic losses.[120] The strength of the Manchester United brand was bolstered by intense off-the-field media attention to individual players, most notably David Beckham (who quickly developed his own global brand). This attention often generates greater interest in on-the-field activities, and hence generates sponsorship opportunities  the value of which is driven by television exposure.[121] During his time with the club, Beckhams popularity across Asia was integral to the clubs commercial success in that part of the world.[122] Because higher league placement results in a greater share of television rights, success on the field generates greater income for the club. Since the inception of the Premier League, Manchester United has received the largest share of the revenue generated from the BSkyB broadcasting deal.[123] Manchester United has also consistently enjoyed the highest commercial income of any English club; in 200506, the clubs commercial arm generated 51million, compared to 42.5million at Chelsea, 39.3million at Liverpool, 34million at Arsenal and 27.9million at Newcastle United. A key sponsorship relationship is with sportswear company Nike, who manage the clubs merchandising operation as part of a 303million 13-year partnership established in 2002.[124] Through Manchester United Finance and the clubs membership scheme, One United, those with an affinity for the club can purchase a range of branded goods and services. Additionally, Manchester United-branded media services  such as the clubs dedicated television channel, MUTV  have allowed the club to expand its fan base to those beyond the reach of its Old Trafford stadium.[12] In an initial five-year deal worth 500,000, Sharp Electronics became the clubs first shirt sponsor at the beginning of the 198283 season, a relationship that lasted until the end of the 19992000 season, when Vodafone agreed a four-year, 30million deal.[125] Vodafone agreed to pay 36million to extend the deal by four years, but after two seasons triggered a break clause in order to concentrate on its sponsorship of the Champions League.[125] To commence at the start of the 200607 season, American insurance corporation AIG agreed a four-year 56.5million deal which in September 2006 became the most valuable in the world.[126][127] At the beginning of the 201011 season, American reinsurance company Aon became the clubs principal sponsor in a four-year deal reputed to be worth approximately 80million, making it the most lucrative shirt sponsorship deal in football history.[128] Manchester United announced their first training kit sponsor in August 2011, agreeing a four-year deal with DHL reported to be worth 40million; it is believed to be the first instance of training kit sponsorship in English football.[129][130] The DHL contract lasted for over a year before the club bought back the contract in October 2012, although they remained the clubs official logistics partner.[131] The contract for the training kit sponsorship was then sold to Aon in April 2013 for a deal worth 180million over eight years, which also included purchasing the naming rights for the Trafford Training Centre.[132] The clubs first kit manufacturer was Umbro, until a five-year deal was agreed with Admiral Sportswear in 1975.[133] Adidas received the contract in 1980,[134] before Umbro started a second spell in 1992.[135] Umbros sponsorship lasted for ten years, followed by Nikes record-breaking 302.9million deal that lasted until 2015; 3.8million replica shirts were sold in the first 22 months with the company.[136][137] In addition to Nike and Chevrolet, the club also has several lower-level platinum sponsors, including Aon and Budweiser.[138] On 30 July 2012, United signed a seven-year deal with American automotive corporation General Motors, which replaced Aon as the shirt sponsor from the 201415 season. The new $80m-a-year shirt deal is worth $559m over seven years and features the logo of General Motors brand Chevrolet.[139][140] Nike announced that they would not renew their kit supply deal with Manchester United after the 201415 season, citing rising costs.[141][142] Since the start of the 201516 season, Adidas has manufactured Manchester Uniteds kit as part of a world-record 10-year deal worth a minimum of 750million.[143][144] Originally funded by the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway Company, the club became a limited company in 1892 and sold shares to local supporters for 1 via an application form.[17] In 1902, majority ownership passed to the four local businessmen who invested 500 to save the club from bankruptcy, including future club president John Henry Davies.[17] After his death in 1927, the club faced bankruptcy yet again, but was saved in December 1931 by James W. Gibson, who assumed control of the club after an investment of 2,000.[21] Gibson promoted his son, Alan, to the board in 1948,[145] but died three years later; the Gibson family retained ownership of the club through James wife, Lillian,[146] but the position of chairman passed to former player Harold Hardman.[147] Promoted to the board a few days after the Munich air disaster, Louis Edwards, a friend of Matt Busby, began acquiring shares in the club; for an investment of approximately 40,000, he accumulated a 54percent shareholding and took control in January 1964.[148] When Lillian Gibson died in January 1971, her shares passed to Alan Gibson who sold a percentage of his shares to Louis Edwards son, Martin, in 1978; Martin Edwards went on to become chairman upon his fathers death in 1980.[149] Media tycoon Robert Maxwell attempted to buy the club in 1984, but did not meet Edwards asking price.[149] In 1989, chairman Martin Edwards attempted to sell the club to Michael Knighton for 20million, but the sale fell through and Knighton joined the Board of Directors instead.[149] Manchester United was floated on the stock market in June 1991 (raising 6.7million),[150] and received yet another takeover bid in 1998, this time from Rupert Murdochs British Sky Broadcasting Corporation. This resulted in the formation of Shareholders United Against Murdoch  now the Manchester United Supporters Trust  who encouraged supporters to buy shares in the club in an attempt to block any hostile takeover. The Manchester United board accepted a 623million offer,[151] but the takeover was blocked by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission at the final hurdle in April 1999.[152] A few years later, a power struggle emerged between the clubs manager, Alex Ferguson, and his horse-racing partners, John Magnier and J. P. McManus, who had gradually become the majority shareholders. In a dispute that stemmed from contested ownership of the horse Rock of Gibraltar, Magnier and McManus attempted to have Ferguson removed from his position as manager, and the board responded by approaching investors to attempt to reduce the Irishmens majority.[153] In May 2005, Malcolm Glazer purchased the 28.7percent stake held by McManus and Magnier, thus acquiring a controlling interest through his investment vehicle Red Football Ltd in a highly leveraged takeover valuing the club at approximately 800million (then approx. $1.5billion).[154] Once the purchase was complete, the club was taken off the stock exchange.[155] In July 2006, the club announced a 660million debt refinancing package, resulting in a 30percent reduction in annual interest payments to 62million a year.[156][157] In January 2010, with debts of 716.5million ($1.17billion),[158] Manchester United further refinanced through a bond issue worth 504million, enabling them to pay off most of the 509million owed to international banks.[159] The annual interest payable on the bonds  which mature on 1 February 2017  is approximately 45million per annum.[160] Despite restructuring, the clubs debt prompted protests from fans on 23 January 2010, at Old Trafford and the clubs Trafford Training Centre.[161][162] Supporter groups encouraged match-going fans to wear green and gold, the colours of Newton Heath. On 30 January, reports emerged that the Manchester United Supporters Trust had held meetings with a group of wealthy fans, dubbed the Red Knights, with plans to buying out the Glazers controlling interest.[163] In August 2011, the Glazers were believed to have approached Credit Suisse in preparation for a $1billion (approx. 600million) initial public offering (IPO) on the Singapore stock exchange that would value the club at more than 2billion.[164] However, in July 2012, the club announced plans to list its IPO on the New York Stock Exchange instead.[165] Shares were originally set to go on sale for between $16 and $20 each, but the price was cut to $14 by the launch of the IPO on 10 August, following negative comments from Wall Street analysts and Facebooks disappointing stock market debut in May. Even after the cut, Manchester United was valued at $2.3billion, making it the most valuable football club in the world.[166] Note: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules. Players may hold more than one non-FIFA nationality. Manchester United are one of the most successful clubs in Europe.[207] The clubs first trophy was the Manchester Cup, which it won as Newton Heath LYR in 1886.[208] In 1908, the club won its first league title, and won the FA Cup for the first time the following year. Manchester United won the most trophies in the 1990s; five league titles, four FA Cups, one League Cup, five Charity Shields (one shared), one UEFA Champions League, one UEFA Cup Winners Cup, one UEFA Super Cup and one Intercontinental Cup. The club holds the record for most top-division titles (20)  including a record 13 Premier League titles  and FA Community Shields (21). It was also the first English club to win the European Cup in 1968, and, as of 2016[update], is the only British club to have won the Club World Cup, in 2008. United also became the sole British club to win the Intercontinental Cup, in 1999. The clubs most recent trophy came in May 2017, with the 201617 UEFA Europa League. In winning the 201617 UEFA Europa League, United became the fifth club in history to have won the European Treble of European Cup/UEFA Champions League, European Cup Winners Cup/UEFA Cup Winners Cup, and UEFA Cup/UEFA Europa League after Juventus, Ajax, Bayern Munich and Chelsea.[209] They are also the first and thus far only English club to have achieved a clean sweep of all trophies available to them.[210] Especially short competitions such as the Charity/Community Shield, Intercontinental Cup (now defunct), FIFA Club World Cup or UEFA Super Cup are not generally considered to contribute towards a Double or Treble.[211]

They compete in the Premier League, the top tier of English football. The club has won 5 European Cups, 3 UEFA Cups, 3 UEFA Super Cups, 18 League titles, 7 FA Cups, a record 8 League Cups, and 15 FA Community Shields. The club was founded in 1892 and joined the Football League the following year. The club has played at Anfield since its formation. Liverpool established itself as a major force in both English and European football during the 1970s and 1980s when Bill Shankly and Bob Paisley led the club to 11 League titles and seven European trophies. Under the management of Rafa Bentez and captained by Steven Gerrard Liverpool became European champion for the fifth time, winning the 2005 UEFA Champions League Final against Milan in spite of being 30 down at half time. Liverpool was the ninth highest-earning football club in the world for 201415, with an annual revenue of 391million,[3] and the worlds eighth most valuable football club in 2016, valued at $1.55 billion.[4] The club holds many long-standing rivalries, most notably the North West Derby against Manchester United and the Merseyside derby with Everton. The clubs supporters have been involved in two major tragedies. The first was the Heysel Stadium disaster in 1985, where escaping fans were pressed against a collapsing wall in the Heysel Stadium, with 39 peoplemostly Italians and Juventus fansdying, after which English clubs were given a five-year ban from European competition. The second was the Hillsborough disaster in 1989, where 96 Liverpool supporters died in a crush against perimeter fencing. The team changed from red shirts and white shorts to an all-red home strip in 1964 which has been used ever since. The clubs anthem is Youll Never Walk Alone.   Liverpool F.C. was founded following a dispute between the Everton committee and John Houlding, club president and owner of the land at Anfield. After eight years at the stadium, Everton relocated to Goodison Park in 1892 and Houlding founded Liverpool F.C. to play at Anfield.[5] Originally named Everton F.C. and Athletic Grounds Ltd (Everton Athletic for short), the club became Liverpool F.C. in March 1892 and gained official recognition three months later, after The Football Association refused to recognise the club as Everton.[6] The team won the Lancashire League in its dbut season, and joined the Football League Second Division at the start of the 189394 season. After finishing in first place the club was promoted to the First Division, which it won in 1901 and again in 1906.[7] Liverpool reached its first FA Cup Final in 1914, losing 10 to Burnley. It won consecutive League championships in 1922 and 1923, but did not win another trophy until the 194647 season, when the club won the First Division for a fifth time under the control of ex-West Ham Utd centre half George Kay.[8] Liverpool suffered its second Cup Final defeat in 1950, playing against Arsenal.[9] The club was relegated to the Second Division in the 195354 season.[10] Soon after Liverpool lost 21 to non-league Worcester City in the 195859 FA Cup, Bill Shankly was appointed manager. Upon his arrival he released 24players and converted a boot storage room at Anfield into a room where the coaches could discuss strategy; here, Shankly and other Boot Room members Joe Fagan, Reuben Bennett, and Bob Paisley began reshaping the team.[11] The club was promoted back into the First Division in 1962 and won it in 1964, for the first time in 17 years. In 1965, the club won its first FA Cup. In 1966, the club won the First Division but lost to Borussia Dortmund in the European Cup Winners Cup final.[12] Liverpool won both the League and the UEFA Cup during the 197273 season, and the FA Cup again a year later. Shankly retired soon afterwards and was replaced by his assistant, Bob Paisley.[13] In 1976, Paisleys second season as manager, the club won another League and UEFA Cup double. The following season, the club retained the League title and won the European Cup for the first time, but it lost in the 1977 FA Cup Final. Liverpool retained the European Cup in 1978 and regained the First Division title in 1979.[14] During Paisleys nine seasons as manager Liverpool won 21 trophies, including three European Cups, a UEFA Cup, six League titles and three consecutive League Cups; the only domestic trophy he did not win was the FA Cup.[15] Paisley retired in 1983 and was replaced by his assistant, Joe Fagan.[16] Liverpool won the League, League Cup and European Cup in Fagans first season, becoming the first English side to win three trophies in a season.[17] Liverpool reached the European Cup final again in 1985, against Juventus at the Heysel Stadium. Before kick-off, Liverpool fans breached a fence which separated the two groups of supporters, and charged the Juventus fans. The resulting weight of people caused a retaining wall to collapse, killing 39 fans, mostly Italians. The incident became known as the Heysel Stadium disaster. The match was played in spite of protests by both managers, and Liverpool lost 10 to Juventus. As a result of the tragedy, English clubs were banned from participating in European competition for five years; Liverpool received a ten-year ban, which was later reduced to six years. Fourteen Liverpool fans received convictions for involuntary manslaughter.[18] Fagan had announced his retirement just before the disaster and Kenny Dalglish was appointed as player-manager.[19] During his tenure, the club won another three League Championships and two FA Cups, including a League and Cup Double in the 198586 season. Liverpools success was overshadowed by the Hillsborough disaster: in an FA Cup semi-final against Nottingham Forest on 15 April 1989, hundreds of Liverpool fans were crushed against perimeter fencing.[20] Ninety-four fans died that day; the 95th victim died in hospital from his injuries four days later and the 96th died nearly four years later, without regaining consciousness.[21] After the Hillsborough disaster there was a government review of stadium safety. The resulting Taylor Report paved the way for legislation that required top-division teams to have all-seater stadiums. The report ruled that the main reason for the disaster was overcrowding due to a failure of police control.[22] Liverpool was involved in the closest finish to a league season during the 198889 season. Liverpool finished equal with Arsenal on both points and goal difference, but lost the title on total goals scored when Arsenal scored the final goal in the last minute of the season.[23] Dalglish cited the Hillsborough disaster and its repercussions as the reason for his resignation in 1991; he was replaced by former player Graeme Souness.[24] Under his leadership Liverpool won the 1992 FA Cup Final, but their league performances slumped, with two consecutive sixth-place finishes, eventually resulting in his dismissal in January 1994. Souness was replaced by Roy Evans, and Liverpool went on to win the 1995 Football League Cup Final. While they made some title challenges under Evans, third-place finishes in 1996 and 1998 were the best they could manage, and so Grard Houllier was appointed co-manager in the 199899 season, and became the sole manager in November 1998 after Evans resigned.[25] In 2001, Houlliers second full season in charge, Liverpool won a Treble: the FA Cup, League Cup and UEFA Cup.[26] Houllier underwent major heart surgery during the 200102 season and Liverpool finished second in the League, behind Arsenal.[27] They won a further League Cup in 2003, but failed to mount a title challenge in the two seasons that followed. Houllier was replaced by Rafael Bentez at the end of the 200304 season. Despite finishing fifth in Bentezs first season, Liverpool won the 200405 UEFA Champions League, beating A.C. Milan 32 in a penalty shootout after the match ended with a score of 33.[28] The following season, Liverpool finished third in the Premier League and won the 2006 FA Cup Final, beating West Ham United in a penalty shootout after the match finished 33.[29] American businessmen George Gillett and Tom Hicks became the owners of the club during the 200607 season, in a deal which valued the club and its outstanding debts at 218.9million.[30] The club reached the 2007 UEFA Champions League Final against Milan, as it had in 2005, but lost 21.[31] During the 200809 season Liverpool achieved 86 points, its highest Premier League points total, and finished as runners up to Manchester United.[32] In the 200910 season, Liverpool finished seventh in the Premier League and failed to qualify for the Champions League. Bentez subsequently left by mutual consent[33] and was replaced by Fulham manager Roy Hodgson.[34] At the start of the 201011 season Liverpool was on the verge of bankruptcy and the clubs creditors asked the High Court to allow the sale of the club, overruling the wishes of Hicks and Gillett. John W. Henry, owner of the Boston Red Sox and of Fenway Sports Group, bid successfully for the club and took ownership in October 2010.[35] Poor results during the start of that season led to Hodgson leaving the club by mutual consent and former player and manager Kenny Dalglish taking over.[36] Despite a record 8th League Cup success against Cardiff and an FA Cup final defeat to Chelsea, Liverpool finished in eighth position in the 201112 season, the worst league finish in 18 years and led to the sacking of Dalglish.[37][38] He was replaced by Brendan Rodgers.[39] In Rodgers first season, Liverpool finished in seventh. In the 201314 season, Liverpool mounted an unexpected title charge to finish second behind champions Manchester City and subsequently return to the Champions League, scoring 101 goals in the process, the most since the 106 scored in the 189596 season.[40][41] Following a disappointing 201415 season, where Liverpool finished sixth in the league, and a poor start to the 201516 season, Brendan Rodgers was sacked in October 2015.[42] He was replaced by Jrgen Klopp,[43] who became the third foreign manager in Liverpools history.[44] In Klopps first season at Liverpool, he took the club to the finals of both the Football League Cup and UEFA Europa League, finishing as runner-up in both competitions.[45] For much of Liverpools history its home colours have been all red, but when the club was founded its kit was more like the contemporary Everton kit. The blue and white quartered shirts were used until 1894, when the club adopted the citys colour of red.[5] The citys symbol of the liver bird was adopted as the clubs badge in 1901, although it was not incorporated into the kit until 1955. Liverpool continued to wear red shirts and white shorts until 1964, when manager Bill Shankly decided to change to an all red strip.[46] Liverpool played in all red for the first time against Anderlecht, as Ian St. John recalled in his autobiography: He [Shankly] thought the colour scheme would carry psychological impactred for danger, red for power. He came into the dressing room one day and threw a pair of red shorts to Ronnie Yeats. Get into those shorts and lets see how you look, he said. Christ, Ronnie, you look awesome, terrifying. You look 7ft tall. Why not go the whole hog, boss? I suggested. Why not wear red socks? Lets go out all in red. Shankly approved and an iconic kit was born.[47] The Liverpool away strip has more often than not been all yellow or white shirts and black shorts, but there have been several exceptions. An all grey kit was introduced in 1987, which was used until the 199192 centenary season, when it was replaced by a combination of green shirts and white shorts. After various colour combinations in the 1990s, including gold and navy, bright yellow, black and grey, and ecru, the club alternated between yellow and white away kits until the 200809 season, when it re-introduced the grey kit. A third kit is designed for European away matches, though it is also worn in domestic away matches on occasions when the current away kit clashes with a teams home kit. Between 2012-15, the kits were designed by Warrior Sports, who became the clubs kit providers at the start of the 201213 season.[48] In February 2015, Warriors parent company New Balance announced it would be entering the global football market, with teams sponsored by Warrior now being outfitted by New Balance.[49] The only other branded shirts worn by the club were made by Umbro until 1985, when they were replaced by Adidas, who produced the kits until 1996 when Reebok took over. They produced the kits for ten years before Adidas made the kits from 2006 to 2012.[50] Liverpool was the first English professional club to have a sponsors logo on its shirts, after agreeing a deal with Hitachi in 1979.[51] Since then the club has been sponsored by Crown Paints, Candy, Carlsberg and Standard Chartered Bank. The contract with Carlsberg, which was signed in 1992, was the longest-lasting agreement in English top-flight football.[52] The association with Carlsberg ended at the start of the 201011 season, when Standard Chartered Bank became the clubs sponsor.[53] The Liverpool badge is based on the citys liver bird, which in the past had been placed inside a shield. In 1992, to commemorate the centennial of the club, a new badge was commissioned, including a representation of the Shankly Gates. The next year twin flames were added at either side, symbolic of the Hillsborough memorial outside Anfield, where an eternal flame burns in memory of those who died in the Hillsborough disaster.[54] In 2012, Warrior Sports first Liverpool kit removed the shield and gates, returning the badge to what had adorned Liverpool shirts in the 1970s; the flames were moved to the back collar of the shirt, surrounding the number 96 for the number who died at Hillsborough.[55] Anfield was built in 1884 on land adjacent to Stanley Park. It was originally used by Everton before the club moved to Goodison Park after a dispute over rent with Anfield owner John Houlding.[56] Left with an empty ground, Houlding founded Liverpool in 1892 and the club has played at Anfield ever since. The capacity of the stadium at the time was 20,000, although only 100 spectators attended Liverpools first match at Anfield.[57] The Kop was built in 1906 due to the high turnout for matches and was called the Oakfield Road Embankment initially. Its first game was on 1 September 1906 when the home side beat Stoke City 10.[58] In 1906 the banked stand at one end of the ground was formally renamed the Spion Kop after a hill in KwaZulu-Natal.[59] The hill was the site of the Battle of Spion Kop in the Second Boer War, where over 300 men of the Lancashire Regiment died, many of them from Liverpool.[60] At its peak, the stand could hold 28,000 spectators and was one of the largest single-tier stands in the world. Many stadia in England had stands named after Spion Kop, but Anfields was the largest of them at the time; it could hold more supportersc than some entire football grounds.[61] Anfield could accommodate more than 60,000 supporters at its peak, and had a capacity of 55,000 until the 1990s. The Taylor Report and Premier League regulations obliged Liverpool to convert Anfield to an all-seater stadium in time for the 199394 season, reducing the capacity to 45,276.[62] The findings of the Taylor Report precipitated the redevelopment of the Kemlyn Road Stand, which was rebuilt in 1992, coinciding with the centenary of the club, and was known as the Centenary Stand until 2017 when it was renamed the Kenny Dalglish Stand. An extra tier was added to the Anfield Road end in 1998, which further increased the capacity of the ground but gave rise to problems when it was opened. A series of support poles and stanchions were inserted to give extra stability to the top tier of the stand after movement of the tier was reported at the start of the 19992000 season.[63] Because of restrictions on expanding the capacity at Anfield, Liverpool announced plans to move to the proposed Stanley Park Stadium in May 2002.[64] Planning permission was granted in July 2004,[65] and in September 2006, Liverpool City Council agreed to grant Liverpool a 999-year lease on the proposed site.[66] Following the takeover of the club by George Gillett and Tom Hicks in February 2007, the proposed stadium was redesigned. The new design was approved by the Council in November 2007. The stadium was scheduled to open in August 2011 and would hold 60,000 spectators, with HKS, Inc. contracted to build the stadium.[67] Construction was halted in August 2008, as Gillett and Hicks had difficulty in financing the 300million needed for the development.[68] In October 2012, BBC Sport reported that Fenway Sports Group, the new owners of Liverpool FC, had decided to redevelop their current home at Anfield stadium, rather than building a new stadium in Stanley Park. As part of the redevelopment the capacity of Anfield was to increase from 45,276 to approximately 60,000 and would cost approximately 150m.[69] When construction was completed on the new Main stand the capacity of Anfield was increased to 54,074. This 100 million expansion added a third tier to the stand. This was all part of a 260 million project to improve the Anfield area. Jurgen Klopp the manager at the time described the stand as impressive.[70] Liverpool is one of the best supported clubs in Europe.[71] The club states that its worldwide fan base includes more than 200officially recognised Club of the LFC Official Supporters Clubs in at least 50 countries. Notable groups include Spirit of Shankly and Reclaim The Kop.[72] The club takes advantage of this support through its worldwide summer tours.[73] Liverpool fans often refer to themselves as Kopites, a reference to the fans who once stood, and now sit, on the Kop at Anfield.[74] In 2008 a group of fans decided to form a splinter club, A.F.C. Liverpool, to play matches for fans who had been priced out of watching Premier League football.[75] The song Youll Never Walk Alone, originally from the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical Carousel and later recorded by Liverpool musicians Gerry & The Pacemakers, is the clubs anthem and has been sung by the Anfield crowd since the early 1960s. It has since gained popularity among fans of other clubs around the world.[76] The songs title adorns the top of the Shankly Gates, which were unveiled on 2 August 1982 in memory of former manager Bill Shankly. The Youll Never Walk Alone portion of the Shankly Gates is also reproduced on the clubs crest. The clubs supporters have been involved in two stadium disasters. The first was the 1985 Heysel Stadium disaster, in which 39 Juventus supporters were killed. They were confined to a corner by Liverpool fans who had charged in their direction; the weight of the cornered fans caused a wall to collapse. UEFA laid the blame for the incident solely on the Liverpool supporters,[77] and banned all English clubs from European competition for five years. Liverpool was banned for an additional year, preventing it from participating in the 199091 European Cup, even though it won the League in 1990.[78] Twenty-seven fans were arrested on suspicion of manslaughter and were extradited to Belgium in 1987 to face trial.[79] In 1989, after a five-month trial in Belgium, 14Liverpool fans were given three-year sentences for involuntary manslaughter;[80] half of the terms were suspended.[81] The second disaster took place during an FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest at Hillsborough Stadium, Sheffield, on 15 April 1989. Ninety-six Liverpool fans died as a consequence of overcrowding at the Leppings Lane end, in what became known as the Hillsborough disaster. In the following days The Sun newspaper published an article entitled The Truth, in which it claimed that Liverpool fans had robbed the dead and had urinated on and attacked the police.[82] Subsequent investigations proved the allegations false, leading to a boycott of the newspaper by Liverpool fans across the city and elsewhere; many still refuse to buy The Sun more than 20years later.[83] Many support organisations were set up in the wake of the disaster, such as the Hillsborough Justice Campaign, which represents bereaved families, survivors and supporters in their efforts to secure justice.[84] Liverpools longest-established rivalry is with fellow Merseyside and Liverpool-based team Everton, against whom the club contest the Merseyside derby. Their rivalry stems from Liverpools formation and the dispute with Everton officials and the then owners of Anfield. Unlike other rivalries, there is no political, geographical or religious split between Liverpool and Everton.[85] The Merseyside derby is usually sold out. It is one of the few local derbies which do not enforce fan segregation, and hence was known as the friendly derby.[86] Since the mid-1980s, the rivalry has intensified both on and off the field and, since the inception of the Premier League in 1992, the Merseyside derby has had more players sent off than any other Premier League game. It has been referred to as the most ill-disciplined and explosive fixture in the Premier League.[87] Liverpools rivalry with Manchester United is viewed as a manifestation of the cities competition during the Industrial Revolution of the 19th century.[88] The two clubs alternated as champions between 1964 and 1967,[89] and Manchester United became the first English team to win the European Cup in 1968, followed by Liverpools four European Cup victories.[90] Despite the 38 league titles and eight European Cups between them[89] the two rivals have rarely been successful at the same time Liverpools run of titles in the 1970s and 1980s coincided with Manchester Uniteds 26-year title drought, and Uniteds success in the Premier League-era has likewise coincided with Liverpools ongoing drought,[91] and the two clubs have finished first and second in the league only five times.[89] Nonetheless, former Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson said in 2002, My greatest challenge was knocking Liverpool right off their fucking perch,[92] and the last player to be transferred between the two clubs was Phil Chisnall, who moved to Liverpool from Manchester United in 1964.[93] As the owner of Anfield and founder of Liverpool, John Houlding was the clubs first chairman, a position he held from its founding in 1892 until 1904. John McKenna took over as chairman after Houldings departure.[94] McKenna subsequently became President of the Football League.[95] The chairmanship changed hands many times before John Smith, whose father was a shareholder of the club, took up the role in 1973. He oversaw the most successful period in Liverpools history before stepping down in 1990.[96] His successor was Noel White who became Chairman in 1990[97] In August 1991 David Moores, whose family had owned the club for more than 50 years became Chairman. His uncle John Moores was also a shareholder at Liverpool and was chairman of Everton from 1961 to 1973. Moores owned 51percent of the club, and in 2004 expressed his willingness to consider a bid for his shares in Liverpool.[98] Moores eventually sold the club to American businessmen George Gillett and Tom Hicks on 6 February 2007. The deal valued the club and its outstanding debts at 218.9million. The pair paid 5,000per share, or 174.1m for the total shareholding and 44.8m to cover the clubs debts.[99] Disagreements between Gillett and Hicks, and the fans lack of support for them, resulted in the pair looking to sell the club.[100] Martin Broughton was appointed chairman of the club on 16 April 2010 to oversee its sale.[101] In May 2010, accounts were released showing the holding company of the club to be 350m in debt (due to leveraged takeover) with losses of 55m, causing auditor KPMG to qualify its audit opinion.[102] The groups creditors, including the Royal Bank of Scotland, took Gillett and Hicks to court to force them to allow the board to proceed with the sale of the club, the major asset of the holding company. A High Court judge, Mr Justice Floyd, ruled in favour of the creditors and paved the way for the sale of the club to Fenway Sports Group (formerly New England Sports Ventures), although Gillett and Hicks still had the option to appeal.[103] Liverpool was sold to Fenway Sports Group on 15 October 2010 for 300m.[104] Liverpool has been described as a global brand; a 2010 report valued the clubs trademarks and associated intellectual property at 141m, an increase of 5m on the previous year. Liverpool was given a brand rating of AA (Very Strong).[105] In April 2010 business magazine Forbes ranked Liverpool as the sixth most valuable football team in the world, behind Manchester United, Real Madrid, Arsenal, Barcelona and Bayern Munich; they valued the club at $822m(532m), excluding debt.[106] Accountants Deloitte ranked Liverpool eighth in the Deloitte Football Money League, which ranks the worlds football clubs in terms of revenue. Liverpools income in the 200910 season was 225.3m.[107] Because of its successful history, Liverpool is often featured when football is depicted in British culture and has appeared in a number of media firsts. The club appeared in the first edition of the BBCs Match of the Day, which screened highlights of its match against Arsenal at Anfield on 22 August 1964. The first football match to be televised in colour was between Liverpool and West Ham United, broadcast live in March 1967.[108] Liverpool fans featured in the Pink Floyd song Fearless, in which they sang excerpts from Youll Never Walk Alone.[109] To mark the clubs appearance in the 1988 FA Cup Final, Liverpool released a song known as the Anfield Rap, featuring John Barnes and other members of the squad.[110] A documentary drama on the Hillsborough disaster, written by Jimmy McGovern, was screened in 1996. It featured Christopher Eccleston as Trevor Hicks, whose story is the focus of the script. Hicks, who lost two teenage daughters in the disaster, went on to campaign for safer stadiums and helped to form the Hillsborough Families Support Group.[111] Liverpool featured in the film The 51st State (also known as Formula 51), in which ex-hitman Felix DeSouza (Robert Carlyle) is a keen supporter of the team and the last scene takes place at a match between Liverpool and Manchester United.[112] The club was featured in a childrens television show called Scully; the plot revolved around a young boy, Francis Scully, who tried to gain a trial match with Liverpool. The show featured prominent Liverpool players of the time such as Kenny Dalglish.[113] Note: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules.

Since the establishment of the club in 1892, 45 players have been club captain of Liverpool F.C.[115] Andrew Hannah became the first captain of the club after Liverpool separated from Everton and formed its own club. Initially Alex Raisbeck, who was club captain from 1899 to 1909, was the longest serving captain before being overtaken by Steven Gerrard who served 12 seasons as Liverpool captain starting from the 200304 season.[115] The present captain is Jordan Henderson, who replaced Gerrard in the 201516 season following Gerrards move to LA Galaxy.[116][117] Liverpools first trophy was the Lancashire League, which it won in the clubs first season.[140] In 1901, the club won its first League title, while its first success in the FA Cup was in 1965. In terms of the number of trophies won, Liverpools most successful decade was the 1980s, when the club won six League titles, two FA Cups, four League Cups, five Charity Shields (one shared) and two European Cups. The club has accumulated more top-flight wins and points than any other English team.[141] Liverpool also has the highest average league finishing position (3.3) for the 50-year period to 2015[142] and second-highest average league finishing position for the period 19001999 after Arsenal, with an average league placing of 8.7.[143] Liverpool has won the European Cup, Europes premier club competition, five times, an English record and only surpassed by Real Madrid and A.C. Milan. Liverpools fifth European Cup win, in 2005, meant that the club was awarded the trophy permanently and was also awarded a multiple-winner badge.[144][145] Liverpool has won the UEFA Cup, Europes secondary club competition, three times.[146] Especially short competitions, such as the FA Community Shield and the UEFA Super Cup, are not generally considered to contribute towards a Double or Treble.[147] Footnotes Citations

reigning champions. Founded in 1905, the clubs home ground since then has been Stamford Bridge.[4] Chelsea had their first major success in 1955, when they won the league championship. They then won various cup competitions between 1965 and 1971. The clubs greatest period of success has come during the last two decades; winning 21 trophies since 1997.[5] Chelsea have won six national league titles, seven FA Cups, five League Cups and four FA Community Shields, one UEFA Champions League, two UEFA Cup Winners Cups, one UEFA Europa League and one UEFA Super Cup. Chelsea are the only London club to win the UEFA Champions League,[6] and one of five clubs and the first British club, to have won all three of UEFAs major club competitions.[7][8] Chelseas regular kit colours are royal blue shirts and shorts with white socks. The clubs crest has been changed several times in attempts to re-brand the club and modernise its image. The current crest, featuring a ceremonial lion rampant regardant holding a staff, is a modification of the one introduced in the early 1950s.[9] The club have the sixth-highest average all-time attendance in English football.[10] Their average home gate for the 201617 season was 41,507, the sixth highest in the Premier League.[11] Since 2003, Chelsea have been owned by Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich.[12] In 2016, they were ranked by Forbes magazine as the seventh most valuable football club in the world, at 1.15billion ($1.66billion).[13]   In 1904, Gus Mears acquired the Stamford Bridge athletics stadium with the aim of turning it into a football ground. An offer to lease it to nearby Fulham was turned down, so Mears opted to found his own club to use the stadium. As there was already a team named Fulham in the borough, the name of the adjacent borough of Chelsea was chosen for the new club; names like Kensington FC, Stamford Bridge FC and London FC were also considered.[14] Chelsea were founded on 10 March 1905 at The Rising Sun pub (now The Butchers Hook),[2][15] opposite the present-day main entrance to the ground on Fulham Road, and were elected to the Football League shortly afterwards. The club won promotion to the First Division in their second season, and yo-yoed between the First and Second Divisions in their early years. They reached the 1915 FA Cup Final, where they lost to Sheffield United at Old Trafford, and finished third in the First Division in 1920, the clubs best league campaign to that point.[16] Chelsea attracted large crowds[17] and had a reputation for signing big-name players,[18] but success continued to elude the club in the inter-war years. Former Arsenal and England centre-forward Ted Drake became manager in 1952 and proceeded to modernise the club. He removed the clubs Chelsea pensioner crest, improved the youth set-up and training regime, rebuilt the side with shrewd signings from the lower divisions and amateur leagues, and led Chelsea to their first major trophy success  the League championship  in 195455. The following season saw UEFA create the European Champions Cup, but after objections from The Football League and the FA Chelsea were persuaded to withdraw from the competition before it started.[19] Chelsea failed to build on this success, and spent the remainder of the 1950s in mid-table. Drake was dismissed in 1961 and replaced by player-coach Tommy Docherty. Docherty built a new team around the group of talented young players emerging from the clubs youth set-up and Chelsea challenged for honours throughout the 1960s, enduring several near-misses. They were on course for a treble of League, FA Cup and League Cup going into the final stages of the 196465 season, winning the League Cup but faltering late on in the other two.[20] In three seasons the side were beaten in three major semi-finals and were FA Cup runners-up. Under Dochertys successor, Dave Sexton, Chelsea won the FA Cup in 1970, beating Leeds United 21 in a final replay. Chelsea took their first European honour, a UEFA Cup Winners Cup triumph, the following year, with another replayed win, this time over Real Madrid in Athens. The late 1970s through to the 80s was a turbulent period for Chelsea. An ambitious redevelopment of Stamford Bridge threatened the financial stability of the club,[21] star players were sold and the team were relegated. Further problems were caused by a notorious hooligan element among the support, which was to plague the club throughout the decade.[22] In 1982, Chelsea were, at the nadir of their fortunes, acquired by Ken Bates for the nominal sum of 1, although by now the Stamford Bridge freehold had been sold to property developers, meaning the club faced losing their home.[23] On the pitch, the team had fared little better, coming close to relegation to the Third Division for the first time, but in 1983 manager John Neal put together an impressive new team for minimal outlay. Chelsea won the Second Division title in 198384 and established themselves in the top division, before being relegated again in 1988. The club bounced back immediately by winning the Second Division championship in 198889. After a long-running legal battle, Bates reunited the stadium freehold with the club in 1992 by doing a deal with the banks of the property developers, who had been bankrupted by a market crash.[24] Chelseas form in the new Premier League was unconvincing, although they did reach the 1994 FA Cup Final with Glenn Hoddle. It was not until the appointment of Ruud Gullit as player-manager in 1996 that their fortunes changed. He added several top international players to the side, as the club won the FA Cup in 1997 and established themselves as one of Englands top sides again. Gullit was replaced by Gianluca Vialli, who led the team to victory in the League Cup Final, the UEFA Cup Winners Cup Final and the UEFA Super Cup in 1998, the FA Cup in 2000 and their first appearance in the UEFA Champions League. Vialli was sacked in favour of Claudio Ranieri, who guided Chelsea to the 2002 FA Cup Final and Champions League qualification in 200203. In June 2003, Bates sold Chelsea to Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich for 140million.[12] Over 100million was spent on new players, but Ranieri was unable to deliver any trophies,[25] and was replaced by Jos Mourinho.[26] Under Mourinho, Chelsea became the fifth English team to win back-to-back league championships since the Second World War (200405 and 200506),[27] in addition to winning an FA Cup (2007) and two League Cups (2005 and 2007). Mourinho was replaced by Avram Grant,[28] who led the club to their first UEFA Champions League final, which they lost on penalties to Manchester United. In 2009, Guus Hiddink guided Chelsea to another FA Cup success.[29] In 200910, his successor Carlo Ancelotti led them to their first Premier League and FA Cup Double, and becoming the first English top-flight club to score 100 league goals in a season since 1963.[30] In 2012, caretaker manager Roberto Di Matteo led Chelsea to their seventh FA Cup,[31] and their first UEFA Champions League title, beating Bayern Munich 43 on penalties,[32] the first London club to win the trophy.[32] In 2013, interim manager Rafael Bentez guided Chelsea to win the UEFA Europa League against Benfica,[33] becoming the first club to hold two major European titles simultaneously and one of four clubs, and the only British club, to have won all three of UEFAs major club competitions.[34] In the summer of 2013, Mourinho returned as manager, leading Chelsea to League Cup success in March 2015,[35] and their fifth league title two months later.[36] In 201516, Chelsea recorded their lowest Premier League finish in twenty years, placing 10th in the table.[37] The following year, under new coach Antonio Conte, Chelsea won its sixth English title.[38] Chelsea have only had one home ground, Stamford Bridge, where they have played since the teams foundation. It was officially opened on 28 April 1877 and for the first 28 years of its existence it was used almost exclusively by the London Athletic Club as an arena for athletics meetings and not at all for football. In 1904 the ground was acquired by businessman Gus Mears and his brother Joseph, who had also purchased nearby land (formerly a large market garden) with the aim of staging football matches on the now 12.5acre (51,000m) site.[39] Stamford Bridge was designed for the Mears family by the noted football architect Archibald Leitch, who had also designed Ibrox, Craven Cottage and Hampden Park.[40] Most football clubs were founded first, and then sought grounds in which to play, but Chelsea were founded for Stamford Bridge. Starting with an open bowl-like design and one covered terrace, Stamford Bridge had an original capacity of around 100,000.[39] The early 1930s saw the construction of a terrace on the southern part of the ground with a roof that covered around one fifth of the stand. It eventually became known as the Shed End, the home of Chelseas most loyal and vocal supporters, particularly during the 1960s, 70s and 80s. The exact origins of the name are unclear, but the fact that the roof looked like a corrugated iron shed roof played a part.[39] In the early 1970s, the clubs owners announced a modernisation of Stamford Bridge with plans for a state-of-the-art 50,000 all-seater stadium.[39] Work began on the East Stand in 1972 but the project was beset with problems and was never completed; the cost brought the club close to bankruptcy, culminating in the freehold being sold to property developers. Following a long legal battle, it was not until the mid-1990s that Chelseas future at the stadium was secured and renovation work resumed.[39] The north, west and southern parts of the ground were converted into all-seater stands and moved closer to the pitch, a process completed by 2001. When Stamford Bridge was redeveloped in the Bates era many additional features were added to the complex including two hotels, apartments, bars, restaurants, the Chelsea Megastore, and an interactive visitor attraction called Chelsea World of Sport. The intention was that these facilities would provide extra revenue to support the football side of the business, but they were less successful than hoped and before the Abramovich takeover in 2003 the debt taken on to finance them was a major burden on the club. Soon after the takeover a decision was taken to drop the Chelsea Village brand and refocus on Chelsea as a football club. However, the stadium is sometimes still referred to as part of Chelsea Village or The Village. The Stamford Bridge freehold, the pitch, the turnstiles and Chelseas naming rights are now owned by Chelsea Pitch Owners, a non-profit organisation in which fans are the shareholders. The CPO was created to ensure the stadium could never again be sold to developers. As a condition for using the Chelsea FC name, the club has to play its first team matches at Stamford Bridge, which means that if the club moves to a new stadium, they may have to change their name.[41] Chelseas training ground is located in Cobham, Surrey. Chelsea moved to Cobham in 2004. Their previous training ground in Harlington was taken over by QPR in 2005.[42] The new training facilities in Cobham were completed in 2007.[43] Stamford Bridge has been used for a variety of other sporting events since 1905. It hosted the FA Cup Final from 1920 to 1922,[44] has held ten FA Cup Semi-finals (most recently in 1978), ten FA Charity Shield matches (the last in 1970), and three England international matches, the last in 1932; it was also the venue for an unofficial Victory International in 1946.[45] The 2013 UEFA Womens Champions League Final was played at Stamford Bridge.[46] In October 1905 it hosted a rugby union match between the All Blacks and Middlesex,[47] and in 1914 hosted a baseball match between the touring New York Giants and the Chicago White Sox.[48] It was the venue for a boxing match between world flyweight champion Jimmy Wilde and Joe Conn in 1918.[49] The running track was used for dirt track racing between 1928 and 1932,[50] greyhound racing from 1933 to 1968, and Midget car racing in 1948.[51] In 1980, Stamford Bridge hosted the first international floodlit cricket match in the UK, between Essex and the West Indies.[52] It was also the home stadium of the London Monarchs American Football team for the 1997 season.[53] The current club ownership have stated that a larger stadium is necessary in order for Chelsea to stay competitive with rival clubs who have significantly larger stadia, such as Arsenal and Manchester United.[54] Owing to its location next to a main road and two railway lines, fans can only enter the ground via the Fulham Road exits, which places constraints on expansion due to health and safety regulations.[55] The club have consistently affirmed their desire to keep Chelsea at their current home,[56][57][58] but have nonetheless been linked with a move to various nearby sites, including the Earls Court Exhibition Centre, Battersea Power Station and the Chelsea Barracks.[59] In October 2011, a proposal from the club to buy back the freehold to the land on which Stamford Bridge sits was voted down by Chelsea Pitch Owners shareholders.[60] In May 2012, the club made a formal bid to purchase Battersea Power Station, with a view to developing the site into a new stadium,[61] but lost out to a Malaysian consortium.[62] The club subsequently announced plans to redevelop Stamford Bridge into a 60,000-seater stadium.[63] On 11 January 2017 it was announced that the stadium was given the go ahead from Hammersmith and Fulham council for the new 60,000 stadium to be built.[64][65] Chelsea have had four main crests, which all underwent minor variations. The first, adopted when the club was founded, was the image of a Chelsea pensioner, the army veterans who reside at the nearby Royal Hospital Chelsea. This contributed to the clubs original pensioner nickname, and remained for the next half-century, though it never appeared on the shirts. When Ted Drake became Chelsea manager in 1952, he began to modernise the club. Believing the Chelsea pensioner crest to be old-fashioned, he insisted that it be replaced.[66] A stop-gap badge which comprised the initials C.F.C. was adopted for a year. In 1953, the club crest was changed to an upright blue lion looking backwards and holding a staff. It was based on elements in the coat of arms of the Metropolitan Borough of Chelsea[67] with the lion rampant regardant taken from the arms of then club president Viscount Chelsea and the staff from the Abbots of Westminster, former Lords of the Manor of Chelsea. It also featured three red roses, to represent England, and two footballs.[66] This was the first Chelsea crest to appear on the shirts, in the early 1960s. In 1986, with Ken Bates now owner of the club, Chelseas crest was changed again as part of another attempt to modernise and because the old rampant lion badge could not be trademarked.[68] The new badge featured a more naturalistic non-heraldic lion, in white and not blue, standing over the C.F.C. initials. This lasted for the next 19 years, with some modifications such as the use of different colours, including red from 1987 to 1995, and yellow from 1995 until 1999, before the white returned.[69] With the new ownership of Roman Abramovich, and the clubs centenary approaching, combined with demands from fans for the popular 1950s badge to be restored, it was decided that the crest should be changed again in 2005. The new crest was officially adopted for the start of the 200506 season and marked a return to the older design, used from 1953 to 1986, featuring a blue heraldic lion holding a staff. For the centenary season this was accompanied by the words 100 YEARS and CENTENARY 20052006 on the top and bottom of the crest respectively.[9] Chelsea have always worn blue shirts, although they originally used the paler eton blue, which was taken from the racing colours of then club president, Earl Cadogan, and was worn with white shorts and dark blue or black socks.[70] The light blue shirts were replaced by a royal blue version in around 1912.[71] In the 1960s Chelsea manager Tommy Docherty changed the kit again, switching to blue shorts (which have remained ever since) and white socks, believing it made the clubs colours more modern and distinctive, since no other major side used that combination; this kit was first worn during the 196465 season.[72] Since then Chelsea have always worn white socks with their home kit apart from a short spell from 1985 to 1992, when blue socks were reintroduced. Chelseas away colours are usually all yellow or all white with blue trim. More recently, the club have had a number of black or dark blue away kits.[73] As with most teams, they have also had some more unusual ones. At Dochertys behest, in the 1966 FA Cup semi-final they wore blue and black stripes, based on Inter Milans kit.[74] In the mid-1970s, the away strip was a red, white and green kit inspired by the Hungarian national side of the 1950s.[75] Other memorable away kits include an all jade strip worn from 198689, red and white diamonds from 199092, graphite and tangerine from 199496, and luminous yellow from 200708.[73] The graphite and tangerine strip often appears in lists of the worst football kits ever.[76][77] Chelsea are among the most widely supported football clubs in the world.[78][79] They have the sixth highest average all-time attendance in English football[10] and regularly attract over 40,000 fans to Stamford Bridge; they were the seventh best-supported Premier League team in the 201314 season, with an average gate of 41,572.[11] Chelseas traditional fanbase comes from all over the Greater London area including working-class parts such as Hammersmith and Battersea, wealthier areas like Chelsea and Kensington, and from the home counties. There are also numerous official supporters clubs in the United Kingdom and all over the world.[80] Between 2007 and 2012, Chelsea were ranked fourth worldwide in annual replica kit sales, with an average of 910,000.[81] Chelseas official Twitter account has 6.29million followers, the fifth highest among football clubs.[82] At matches, Chelsea fans sing chants such as Carefree (to the tune of Lord of the Dance, whose lyrics were probably written by supporter Mick Greenaway[83][84]), Ten Men Went to Mow, We All Follow the Chelsea (to the tune of Land of Hope and Glory), Zigga Zagga, and the celebratory Celery, with the latter often resulting in fans ritually throwing celery. The vegetable was banned inside Stamford Bridge after an incident involving Arsenal midfielder Cesc Fbregas at the 2007 League Cup Final.[85] During the 1970s and 1980s in particular, Chelsea supporters were associated with football hooliganism. The clubs football firm, originally known as the Chelsea Shed Boys, and subsequently as the Chelsea Headhunters, were nationally notorious for football violence, alongside hooligan firms from other clubs such as West Ham Uniteds Inter City Firm and Millwalls Bushwackers, before, during and after matches.[86] The increase of hooligan incidents in the 1980s led chairman Ken Bates to propose erecting an electric fence to deter them from invading the pitch, a proposal that the Greater London Council rejected.[87] Since the 1990s, there has been a marked decline in crowd trouble at matches, as a result of stricter policing, CCTV in grounds and the advent of all-seater stadia.[88] In 2007, the club launched the Back to the Shed campaign to improve the atmosphere at home matches, with notable success. According to Home Office statistics, 126 Chelsea fans were arrested for football-related offences during the 200910 season, the third highest in the division, and 27 banning orders were issued, the fifth-highest in the division.[89] Chelsea have long-standing rivalries with North London clubs Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur.[90][91] A strong rivalry with Leeds United dates back to several heated and controversial matches in the 1960s and 1970s, particularly the 1970 FA Cup Final.[92] More recently a rivalry with Liverpool has grown following repeated clashes in cup competitions.[93][94] Chelseas fellow West London sides Brentford, Fulham and Queens Park Rangers are generally not considered major rivals, as matches have only taken place intermittently due to the clubs often being in separate divisions.[95] A 2004 survey by Planetfootball.com found that Chelsea fans consider their main rivalries to be with (in order): Arsenal, Tottenham Hotspur and Manchester United. In the same survey, fans of six clubs (Arsenal, Fulham, Leeds United, QPR, Tottenham and West Ham United) named Chelsea as one of their three main rivals.[96] In a 2008 poll conducted by the Football Fans Census, Chelsea fans named Liverpool, Arsenal and Manchester United as their most disliked clubs.[97] However, a 2012 survey has shown that Chelsea fans consider Tottenham to be their main rival, above Arsenal and Manchester United.[98] Chelseas highest appearance-maker is ex-captain Ron Harris, who played in 795 competitive games for the club between 1961 and 1980.[99] The record for a Chelsea goalkeeper is held by Harriss contemporary, Peter Bonetti, who made 729 appearances (195979). With 103 caps (101 while at the club), Frank Lampard of England is Chelseas most capped international player. Frank Lampard is Chelseas all-time top goalscorer, with 211 goals in 648 games (20012014);[99] he passed Bobby Tamblings longstanding record of 202 in May 2013.[100] Seven other players have also scored over 100 goals for Chelsea: George Hilsdon (190612), George Mills (192939), Roy Bentley (194856), Jimmy Greaves (195761), Peter Osgood (196474 and 197879), Kerry Dixon (198392) and Didier Drogba (200412 and 20142015). Greaves holds the record for the most goals scored in one season (43 in 196061).[101] Chelseas biggest winning scoreline in a competitive match is 130, achieved against Jeunesse Hautcharage in the Cup Winners Cup in 1971.[102] The clubs biggest top-flight win was an 80 victory against Wigan Athletic in 2010, which was matched in 2012 against Aston Villa.[103] Chelseas biggest loss was an 81 reverse against Wolverhampton Wanderers in 1953.[104][105] Officially, Chelseas highest home attendance is 82,905 for a First Division match against Arsenal on 12 October 1935. However, an estimated crowd of over 100,000 attended a friendly match against Soviet team Dynamo Moscow on 13 November 1945.[106][107] The modernisation of Stamford Bridge during the 1990s and the introduction of all-seater stands mean that neither record will be broken for the foreseeable future. The current legal capacity of Stamford Bridge is 41,663.[4] Every starting player in Chelseas 57 games of the 201314 season was a full international  a new club record.[108] Chelsea hold the English record for the highest ever points total for a league season (95), the fewest goals conceded during a league season (15), the highest number of clean sheets overall in a Premier League season (25) (all set during the 200405 season),[109] the most consecutive clean sheets from the start of a league season (6, set during the 200506 season),[110] and the highest number of Premier League victories in a season (30), set during the 201617 season.[111] The clubs 210 aggregate victory over Jeunesse Hautcharage in the UEFA Cup Winners Cup in 1971 remains a record in European competition.[112] Chelsea hold the record for the longest streak of unbeaten matches at home in the English top flight, which lasted 86 matches from 20 March 2004 to 26 October 2008. They secured the record on 12 August 2007, beating the previous record of 63 matches unbeaten set by Liverpool between 1978 and 1980.[113][114] Chelseas streak of eleven consecutive away league wins, set between 5 April 2008 and 6 December 2008, is also a record for the English top flight.[115] Their 50million purchase of Fernando Torres from Liverpool in January 2011 was the record transfer fee paid by a British club[116] until ngel Di Mara signed for Manchester United in August 2014 for 59.7million.[117] Chelsea, along with Arsenal, were the first club to play with shirt numbers, on 25 August 1928 in their match against Swansea Town.[118] They were the first English side to travel by aeroplane to a domestic away match, when they visited Newcastle United on 19 April 1957,[119] and the first First Division side to play a match on a Sunday, when they faced Stoke City on 27 January 1974. On 26 December 1999, Chelsea became the first British side to field an entirely foreign starting line-up (no British or Irish players) in a Premier League match against Southampton.[120] In May 2007, Chelsea were the first team to win the FA Cup at the new Wembley Stadium, having also been the last to win it at the old Wembley.[121] They were the first English club to be ranked No. 1 under UEFAs five-year coefficient system in the 21st century.[122] They were the first team in Premier League history to score at least 100 goals in a single season, reaching the milestone on the final day of the 200910 season.[30] Chelsea are the only London club to win the UEFA Champions League, after beating Bayern Munich in the 2012 final.[6][123] Upon winning the 201213 UEFA Europa League, Chelsea became the first English club to win all four European trophies and the only club to hold the Champions League and the Europa League at the same time.[124] Chelsea Football Club were founded by Gus Mears in 1905. After his death in 1912, his descendents continued to own the club until 1982, when Ken Bates bought the club from Mears great-nephew Brian Mears for 1. Bates bought a controlling stake in the club and floated Chelsea on the AIM stock exchange in March 1996.[125] In July 2003, Roman Abramovich purchased just over 50 of Chelsea Village plcs share capital, including Bates 29.5 stake, for 30million and over the following weeks bought out most of the remaining 12,000 shareholders at 35 pence per share, completing a 140million takeover. Other shareholders at the time of the takeover included the Matthew Harding estate (21), BSkyB (9.9) and various anonymous offshore trusts.[126] After passing the 90 share threshold, Abramovich took the club back into private hands, delisting it from the AIM on 22 August 2003. He also took on responsibility for the clubs debt of 80million, quickly paying most of it.[127] Thereafter, Abramovich changed the ownership name to Chelsea FC plc, whose ultimate parent company is Fordstam Limited, which is controlled by him.[128] Chelsea are additionally funded by Abramovich via interest free soft loans channelled through his holding company Fordstam Limited. The loans stood at 709million in December 2009, when they were all converted to equity by Abramovich, leaving the club themselves debt free,[129][130] although the debt remains with Fordstam.[131] Since 2008 the club have had no external debt.[132] Chelsea did not turn a profit in the first nine years of Abramovichs ownership, and made record losses of 140m in June 2005.[133] In November 2012, Chelsea announced a profit of 1.4million for the year ending 30 June 2012, the first time the club had made a profit under Abramovichs ownership.[133][134] This was followed by a loss in 2013 and then their highest ever profit of 18.4million for the year to June 2014.[135] Chelsea have been described as a global brand; a 2012 report by Brand Finance ranked Chelsea fifth among football brands and valued the clubs brand value at US$398million  an increase of 27 from the previous year, also valuing them at US$10million more than the sixth best brand, London rivals Arsenal  and gave the brand a strength rating of AA (very strong).[136][137] In 2016, Forbes magazine ranked Chelsea the seventh most valuable football club in the world, at 1.15billion ($1.66billion).[13] As of 2016, Chelsea are ranked eighth in the Deloitte Football Money League with an annual commercial revenue of 322.59million.[138] Chelseas kit has been manufactured by Adidas since 2006, which was originally contracted to supply the clubs kit from 2006 to 2018. The partnership was extended in October 2010 in a deal worth 160million over eight years.[139] This deal was again extended in June 2013 in a deal worth 300million over another ten years.[140][141] In May 2016, Adidas announced that by mutual agreement, the kit sponsorship would end 6 years early on 30 June 2017.[142] Chelsea had to pay 40m in compensation to Adidas. In October 2016, Nike was announced as the new kit sponsor, in a deal worth 900m over 15 years, until 2032.[143] Previously, the kit was manufactured by Umbro (197581), Le Coq Sportif (198186), The Chelsea Collection (198687) and Umbro again (19872006). Chelseas first shirt sponsor was Gulf Air, agreed during the 198384 season. The club were then sponsored by Grange Farms, Bai Lin Tea and Simod before a long-term deal was signed with Commodore International in 1989; Amiga, an offshoot of Commodore, also appeared on the shirts. Chelsea were subsequently sponsored by Coors beer (199497), Autoglass (19972001), Emirates (200105), Samsung Mobile (200508) and Samsung (200815).[144][145] Chelseas current shirt sponsor is the Yokohama Rubber Company.

football club in Liverpool, England, that currently competes in the Premier League, the top flight of English football. The club have competed in the top division for a record 114 seasons and won the League Championship nine times, and the FA Cup five times. Formed in 1878, Everton were founding members of The Football League in 1888 and won their first League Championship two seasons later. Following four League Championship and two FA Cup wins, Everton experienced a lull in the immediate post World War Two period, until a revival in the 1960s, which saw the club win two League Championships and an FA Cup. The mid-1980s represented their most recent period of sustained success, with two League Championships, an FA Cup, and the 1985 European Cup Winners Cup. The clubs most recent major trophy was the 1995 FA Cup. The clubs supporters are known as Evertonians. Everton have a rivalry with neighbours Liverpool, and the two sides contest the Merseyside derby. The club have been based at Goodison Park in Walton, Liverpool, since 1892, after moving from Anfield following a row over its rent. The clubs home colours are royal blue shirts with white shorts and socks.   Everton were founded as St Domingo FC in 1878[2][3] so that members of the congregation of St Domingo Methodist New Connexion Chapel in Breckfield Road North, Everton could play sport year round cricket was played in summer. The clubs first game was a 10 victory over Everton Church Club.[4] The club was renamed Everton in November 1879 after the local area, as people outside the congregation wished to participate.[4][5] The club was a founding member of the Football League in 188889 and won their first League Championship title in the 189091 season. Everton won the FA Cup for the first time in 1906 and the League Championship again in 191415. The outbreak of the First World War in 1914 interrupted the football programme while Everton were champions, which was something that would again occur in 1939.[6][7] It was not until 1927 that Evertons first sustained period of success began. In 1925 the club signed Dixie Dean from Tranmere Rovers. In 192728, Dean set the record for top-flight league goals in a single season with 60 goals in 39 league games, which is a record that still stands. He helped Everton win their third League Championship that season.[8] However, Everton were relegated to the Second Division two years later during internal turmoil at the club. The club quickly rebounded and was promoted at the first attempt, while scoring a record number of goals in the Second Division. On return to the top flight in 193132, Everton wasted no time in reaffirming their status and won a fourth League Championship at the first opportunity. Everton also won their second FA Cup in 1933 with a 30 win against Manchester City in the final. The era ended in 193839 with a fifth League Championship.[9][10] The outbreak of the Second World War again saw the suspension of league football, and when official competition resumed in 1946, the Everton team had been split up and paled in comparison to the pre-war team. Everton were relegated for the second time in 195051 and did not earn promotion until 195354, when they finished as runners-up in their third season in the Second Division. The club have been a top-flight presence ever since.[11] Evertons second successful era started when Harry Catterick was made manager in 1961. In 196263, his second season in charge, Everton won the League Championship.[12] In 1966 the club won the FA Cup with a 32 win over Sheffield Wednesday.[13] Everton again reached the final in 1968, but this time were unable to overcome West Bromwich Albion at Wembley.[14] Two seasons later in 196970, Everton won the League Championship, finishing nine points clear of nearest rivals Leeds United.[15] During this period, Everton were the first English club to achieve five consecutive years in European competitions  covering the seasons from 196162 to 196667.[16] However, the success did not last; the team finished fourteenth, fifteenth, seventeenth and seventh in the following seasons. Harry Catterick retired, but his successors failed to win any silverware for the remainder of the 1970s despite finishing fourth in 197475 under manager Billy Bingham, third in 197778 and fourth the following season under manager Gordon Lee. Lee was sacked in 1981.[17]  Howard Kendall took over as manager and guided Everton to their most successful era. Domestically, Everton won the FA Cup in 1984 and two League Championships in 198485 and 198687. In Europe, the club won its first, and so far only, European trophy by securing the European Cup Winners Cup in 1985.[18] The European success came after first beating University College Dublin, Inter Bratislava and Fortuna Sittard. Then, Everton defeated German giants Bayern Munich 31 in the semi-finals, despite trailing at half time (in a match voted the greatest in Goodison Park history), and recorded the same scoreline over Austrian club Rapid Vienna in the final.[19] Having won both the League and Cup Winners Cup in 1985, Everton came very close to winning a treble, but lost to Manchester United in the FA Cup final.[18] The following season, 198586, Everton were runners-up to neighbours Liverpool in both the League and the FA Cup, but did recapture the League Championship in 198687. After the Heysel Stadium disaster and the subsequent ban of all English clubs from continental football, Everton lost the chance to compete for more European trophies. A large proportion of the title-winning side was broken up following the ban. Kendall himself moved to Athletic Bilbao after the 1987 title triumph and was succeeded by assistant Colin Harvey. Harvey took Everton to the 1989 FA Cup Final, but lost 32 after extra time to Liverpool. Everton were founding members of the Premier League in 1992, but struggled to find the right manager. Howard Kendall had returned in 1990, but could not repeat his previous success. His successor, Mike Walker, was statistically the least successful Everton manager to date. When former Everton player Joe Royle took over in 1994, the clubs form started to improve; his first game in charge was a 20 victory over derby rivals Liverpool. Royle dragged Everton clear of relegation and led the club to the FA Cup for the fifth time in its history by defeating Manchester United 10 in the final. The cup triumph was also Evertons passport to the Cup Winners Cup  their first European campaign in the post-Heysel era. Progress under Royle continued in 199596 as they climbed to sixth place in the Premiership.[18] A fifteenth-place finish the following season saw Royle resign towards the end of the campaign, and he was temporarily replaced by club captain Dave Watson. Howard Kendall was appointed Everton manager for the third time in 1997, but the appointment proved unsuccessful as Everton finished seventeenth in the Premiership. The club only avoided relegation due to their superior goal difference over Bolton Wanderers. Former Rangers manager Walter Smith then took over from Kendall in the summer of 1998, but only managed three successive finishes in the bottom half of the table.[18] The Everton board finally ran out of patience with Smith, and he was sacked in March 2002 after an FA Cup exit at Middlesbrough and with Everton in real danger of relegation.[20] His replacement, David Moyes, guided Everton to a safe finish in fifteenth place.[21][22] In 200203 Everton finished seventh, which was their highest finish since 1996. It was under Moyes management that Wayne Rooney broke into the first team before being sold to Manchester United for a club record fee of 28million in the summer of 2004.[23] A fourth-place finish in 200405 ensured that Everton qualified for the UEFA Champions League qualifying round. The team failed to make it through to the Champions League group stage and were then eliminated from the UEFA Cup. Everton qualified for the 200708[24] and 200809 UEFA Cup competitions, and they were runners-up in the 2009 FA Cup Final. During this period, Moyes broke the club record for highest transfer fee paid on four occasions: signing James Beattie for 6million in January 2005,[25] Andy Johnson for 8.6million in summer 2006,[25] Yakubu for 11.25million in summer 2007,[26] and Marouane Fellaini for 15million in September 2008.[27] At the end of the 201213 season, Moyes left his position at Everton to take over at Manchester United. He was replaced by Roberto Martnez,[28] who led Everton to 5th place in the Premier League in his first season while amassing the clubs best points tally in 27 years with 72.[29] The following season, Martnez led Everton to the last 16 of the 2014-15 UEFA Europa League, where they were defeated by Dynamo Kyiv,[30] whilst domestically finishing 11th in the Premier League. Everton reached the semi-finals of both the League Cup and the FA Cup in 201516, but were defeated in both. After a poor run of form in the Premier League, Martnez was sacked following the penultimate game of the season, with Everton lying in 12th place.[31] He was replaced in the summer by Ronald Koeman, who left Southampton to sign a 3-year contract with Everton.[32] Evertons traditional home colours are royal blue shirts, white shorts and white socks. However, during the first decades of their history, Everton had several different kit colours. The team originally played in white and then blue and white stripes, but as new players arriving at the club wore their old teams shirts during matches, confusion soon ensued. It was decided that the shirts would be dyed black, both to save on expenses and to instill a more professional look. However, the kit appeared morbid, so a scarlet sash was added.[33] When the club moved to Goodison Park in 1892, the colours were salmon pink and dark blue striped shirts with dark blue shorts. The club later switched to ruby shirts with blue trim and dark blue shorts. Royal blue jerseys with white shorts were first used in the 190102 season.[33] The club played in sky blue in 1906; however, the fans protested, and the colour reverted to royal blue. Occasionally, Everton have played in lighter shades than royal blue (such as in 193031 and 199798).[34] The home kit today is royal blue shirts with white shorts and socks. The club may also wear all blue to avoid any colour clashes. The home goalkeeper attire for the 201415 season was all yellow. Evertons traditional away colours were white shirts with black shorts, but from 1968 amber shirts and royal blue shorts became common. Various editions appeared throughout the 1970s and 1980s. Recently, black, white, grey and yellow away shirts have been used. The away shirt for the 201112 season was reverted to an amber shirt with navy blue shorts.[35] The current away kit is a black shirt with an orange collar, while their third kit is a yellow shirt with blue trim. At the end of the 193738 season, Everton secretary Theo Kelly, who later became the clubs first manager, wanted to design a club necktie. It was agreed that the colour be blue, and Kelly was given the task of designing a crest to be featured on the necktie. He worked on it for four months until deciding on a reproduction of Everton Lock-Up, which stands in the heart of the Everton district.[36] The Lock-Up has been inextricably linked with the Everton area since its construction in 1787. It was originally used as a bridewell to incarcerate mainly drunks and minor criminals, and it still stands today on Everton Brow. The Lock-Up was accompanied by two laurel wreaths on either side and, according to the College of Arms in London, Kelly chose to include the laurels as they were the sign of winners. The crest was accompanied by the club motto, Nil Satis Nisi Optimum, meaning Nothing but the best is good enough.[36] The ties were first worn by Kelly and the Everton chairman, Mr. E. Green, on the first day of the 193839 season.[36] The club rarely incorporated a badge of any description on its shirts. An interwoven EFC design was adopted between 1922 and 1930 before the club reverted to plain royal blue shirts until 1972 when bold EFC lettering was added. The crest designed by Kelly was first used on the teams shirts in 1978 and has remained there ever since, while undergoing gradual change to become the version used today. In May 2013, the club launched a new crest to improve the reproducibility of the design in print and broadcast media, particularly on a small scale.[37] Critics[who?] suggested that it was external pressure from sports manufacturer Nike, Inc. that evoked the redesign as the number of colours had been reduced and the radial effect was removed, which made the kit more cost efficient to reproduce.[citation needed] The redesign was poorly received by supporters, with a poll on an Everton fan site registering a 91 negative response to the crest.[38] A protest petition reached over 22,000 signatures before the club offered an apology and announced a new crest would be created for the 201415 season with an emphasis on fan consultation. Shortly afterwards, the Head of Marketing left the club. The latest crest was revealed by the club on 3 October 2013. After a consultation process with the supporters, three new crests were shortlisted. In the final vote, the new crest was chosen by almost 80 of the supporters that took part[39][40] and began being used in July 2014.[41] Monochrome Everton crest (200013) 201314 season crest Current crest - 201415 season onwards. Evertons most widely recognised nickname The Toffees or The Toffeemen, which came about after Everton had moved to Goodison. There are several explanations for how this name came to be adopted with the best known being that there was a business in Everton village, between Everton Brow and Brow Side, named Mother Nobletts, which was a toffee shop that sold sweets including the Everton Mint. It was also located opposite the lock up which Evertons club crest is based on. The Toffee Lady tradition in which a girl walks around the perimeter of the pitch before the start of a game tossing free Everton Mints into the crowd symbolises the connection. Another possible reason is that there was a house named Ye Anciente Everton Toffee House in nearby Village Street, Everton, run by Ma Bushell. The toffee house was located near the Queens Head hotel in which early club meetings took place.[42] Everton have had many other nicknames over the years. When the black kit was worn, Everton were nicknamed The Black Watch after the famous army regiment.[43] Since going blue in 1901, Everton have been given the simple nickname The Blues. Evertons attractive style of play led to Steve Bloomer calling the team scientific in 1928, which is thought to have inspired the nickname The School of Science.[44] The battling 1995 FA Cup winning side were known as The Dogs of War. When David Moyes arrived as manager, he proclaimed Everton as The Peoples Club, which has been adopted as a semi-official club nickname.[45] Everton originally played in the southeast corner of Stanley Park. The first official match took place in 1879. In 1882, a man named J. Cruitt donated land at Priory Road which became the clubs home. In 1884 Everton became tenants at Anfield, which was owned by John Orrell, a land owner who was a friend of Everton F.C. member John Houlding. Orrell lent Anfield to the club in exchange for a small rent. Houlding purchased the land from Orrell in 1885 and effectively became Evertons landlord by charging the club rent, which increased from 100 to 240 a year by 1888  and was still rising until Everton left the ground in 1892.[46][47] The club regarded the increase in rent as unacceptable.[47] A further dispute between Houlding and the clubs committee led to Houlding attempting to gain full control of the club by registering the company, Everton F.C. and Athletic Grounds Ltd. Everton left Anfield for a new ground, Goodison Park, where the club have played ever since. Houlding attempted to take over Evertons name, colours, fixtures and league position, but was denied by The Football Association. Instead, Houlding formed a new club, Liverpool F.C.[48] Goodison Park, the first major football stadium to be built in England, was opened in 1892.[49] Goodison Park has staged more top-flight football games than any other ground in the United Kingdom and was the only English club ground to host a semi-final at the 1966 FIFA World Cup. It was also the first English ground to have under soil heating and the first to have two tiers on all sides. The church grounds of St Luke the Evangelist are adjacent to the corner of the Main Stand and the Howard Kendall Gwladys Street End.[50] On match days, in a tradition going back to 1962, players walk out to the theme song for Z-Cars, which is named Johnny Todd.[51] It is a traditional Liverpool childrens song collected in 1890 by Frank Kidson and tells the story of a sailor betrayed by his lover while away at sea.[52] On two separate occasions in 1994, the club walked out to different songs. In August 1994, the club played 2 Unlimiteds song Get Ready For This. A month later, the club used a reworking of the Creedence Clearwater Revival classic Bad Moon Rising. Both songs were met with complete disapproval by Everton fans.[53] From 1966 to 2007, Everton trained at Bellefield in the West Derby area of Liverpool.[54] They moved to the Finch Farm training complex in Halewood in 2007. The training ground houses both the Everton first team and the youth academy. There have been indications since 1996 that Everton will move to a new stadium. The original plan was for a new 60,000 seat stadium, but in 2000 a proposal was submitted to build a 55,000 seat stadium as part of the Kings Dock regeneration. This proposal was unsuccessful as Everton failed to generate the 30million needed for a half stake in the stadium project, and the city council rejected the proposal in 2003.[55] Late in 2004, driven by the Liverpool Council and the Northwest Development Corporation, the club entered talks with Liverpool F.C. about sharing a proposed stadium on Stanley Park. However, negotiations broke down as Everton failed to raise 50 of the costs.[56] On 11 January 2005, Liverpool announced that ground-sharing was not a possibility and proceeded to plan their own Stanley Park Stadium.[57] On 16 June 2006, it was announced that Everton had entered into talks with the Knowsley Council and Tesco over the possibility of building a new 55,000 seat stadium, expandable to over 60,000, in Kirkby.[58] The plan became known as The Kirkby Project. The club took the unusual move of giving its supporters a say in the clubs future by holding a ballot on the proposal with the results being in favour of it, 59 to 41.[59] Opponents to the plan included other local councils concerned by the effect of a large Tesco store being built as part of the development and a group of fans demanding that Everton should remain within the city boundaries of Liverpool.[59] Following a public inquiry into the project,[60] the central government rejected the proposal.[61] Local and regional politicians attempted to put together an amended rescue plan with the Liverpool City Council calling a meeting with Everton F.C. The plan was to assess some suitable sites short listed within the city boundary.[62][63] However, the amended plan was also not successful. The Liverpool City Council Regeneration and Transport Select Committee meeting on 10 February 2011 featured a proposal to open the Bootle Branch line using Liverpool Football Club and Everton Football Club as priorities, as economic enablers of the project.[64] This proposal would place both football clubs on a rapid transit Merseyrail line that would circle the city and ease transport access. In September 2014 the club, working with the Liverpool City Council and Liverpool Mutual Homes, outlined initial plans to build a new stadium in Walton Hall Park.[65] However, those plans were later scrapped in May 2016 with the prospect of two new sites being identified for the club.[66] At the Annual General Meeting in January 2017, the chairman, Bill Kenwright revealed that Bramley-Moore Dock was the preferred site for the new stadium, with a new railway station and a new road being funded by the City Council.[67] Everton have a large fanbase, with the eighth highest average attendance in the Premier League in the 200809 season.[68] The majority of Evertons matchday support comes from the North West of England, primarily Merseyside, Cheshire, West Lancashire and parts of Western Greater Manchester along with many fans who travel from North Wales and Ireland. Within the city of Liverpool, support for Everton and city rivals Liverpool is not determined by geographical basis with supporters mixed across the city. However, Evertons support heartland is traditionally based in the North West of the city and in the southern parts of Sefton. Everton also have many supporters clubs worldwide[69] in places such as North America,[70] Singapore,[71] Indonesia, Lebanon, Malaysia,[72] Thailand and Australia.[73][74] The official supporters club is FOREVERTON,[75] and there are also several fanzines including When Skies are Grey and Speke from the Harbour, which are sold around Goodison Park on match days. Everton regularly take large numbers away from home both domestically and in European fixtures. The club implements a loyalty points scheme offering the first opportunity to purchase away tickets to season ticket holders who have attended the most away matches. Everton often sell out the full allocation in away grounds, and tickets sell particularly well for North West England away matches. In October 2009, Everton took 7,000 travelling fans to Benfica,[76] which was their largest ever away crowd in Europe since the 1985 European Cup Winners Cup Final. Evertons biggest rivalry is with neighbours Liverpool, against whom they contest the Merseyside derby. The rivalry stems from an internal dispute between Everton officials and the owners of Anfield, which was then Evertons home ground. The dispute resulted in Everton moving to Goodison Park and the subsequent formation of Liverpool F.C. in 1892. Following these events, a fierce rivalry has existed between Everton and Liverpool, albeit one that is generally perceived as more respectful than many other derbies in English football. This was illustrated by a chain of red and blue scarves that were linked between the gates of both grounds across Stanley Park as a tribute to the Liverpool fans killed in the Hillsborough disaster.[77] The derby is usually a sellout fixture and has been known as the friendly derby because both sets of fans can often be seen side by side dressed in red and blue inside both Anfield and Goodison Park. Recently on the field, matches tend to be extremely stormy affairs; the derby has had more red cards than any other fixture in Premiership history.[78] Note: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules. Players may hold more than one non-FIFA nationality. See also List of Everton F.C. international players. The following players are considered Giants for their great contributions to Everton. A panel appointed by the club established the inaugural list in 2000 and a new inductee is announced every season.[80] At the start of the 200304 season, as part of the clubs official celebration of their 125th anniversary, supporters cast votes to determine the greatest ever Everton team.[82] A number of Everton players have been inducted into the English Football Hall of Fame:[83] The Football League 100 Legends is a list of 100 legendary football players produced by The Football League in 1998 to celebrate the 100th season of League football.[85] Everton F.C. is a limited company with the board of directors holding a majority of the shares.[87] The clubs most recent accounts, from May 2014, show a net total debt of 28.1 million, with a turnover of 120.5 million and a profit of 28.2 million.[88] The clubs overdraft with Barclays Bank is secured against the Premier Leagues Basic Award Fund,[89] which is a guaranteed sum given to clubs for competing in the Premier League.[90] Everton agreed to a long-term loan of 30million with Bear Stearns and Prudential plc in 2002 for a duration of 25 years. The loan was a consolidation of debts at the time as well as a source of capital for new player acquisitions.[91] Goodison Park is secured as collateral. On 27 February 2016, it was announced that Farhad Moshiri would buy a 49.9 stake in the club.[92] Figures taken from 201314 accounts.[93] Since 2004 Evertons shirt sponsor has been Chang Beer. Previous sponsors include Hafnia (197985), NEC (198595), Danka (199597), one2one (19972002) and Kejian (200204). For the 200809 season, Everton sold junior replica jerseys without the current name or logo of its main sponsor Chang Beer, which followed a recommendation from the Portman Group that alcoholic brand names be removed from kits sold to children.[94] Evertons current kit manufacturers are Umbro,[95] who have been the clubs kit manufacturer three times previously (197483, 19862000, and 200409). Other previous manufacturing firms are Le Coq Sportif (198386, 200912),[96] Puma (200004) and Nike (201214).[97] The club currently has two megastores: one located near Goodison Park on Walton Lane named Everton One and one located in the Liverpool One shopping complex named Everton Two, which gives the second store the address Everton Two, Liverpool One.[98] The current manager, Ronald Koeman, is the fifteenth permanent holder of the position since it was established in 1939.[99] There have also been four caretaker managers, and before 1939 the team was selected by either the club secretary or by committee. The clubs longest-serving manager has been Harry Catterick, who was in charge of the team from 196173 for 594 first team matches.[99] The Everton manager to win the most domestic and international trophies is Howard Kendall, who won two First Division championships, the 1984 FA Cup, the 1985 UEFA Cup Winners Cup, and three FA Charity Shields. Neville Southall holds the record for the most Everton appearances with 751 first-team matches between 1981 and 1997. The late centre half and former captain Brian Labone comes in second with 534 matches. The longest serving player is goalkeeper Ted Sagar, who played for 23 years between 1929 and 1953. This tenure covered both sides of the Second World War and included a total of 495 appearances. Southall also previously held the record for the most league clean sheets during a season with 15. However, this record was beaten during the 200809 season by American goalkeeper Tim Howard, who ended the season with 17 clean sheets.[100] The clubs top goalscorer, with 383 goals in all competitions, is Dixie Dean; the second-highest goalscorer is Graeme Sharp with 159. Dean still holds the English national record of most goals in a season with 60.[101] The record attendance for an Everton home match is 78,299 against Liverpool on 18 September 1948. Amazingly, there was only one injury at this game, which occurred when Tom Fleetwood was hit on the head by a coin thrown from the crowd whilst he marched around the perimeter and played the cornet with St Edwards Orphanage Band. Goodison Park, like all major English football grounds since the recommendations of the Taylor Report were implemented, is now an all-seater and only holds just under 40,000, meaning it is unlikely that this attendance record will ever be broken at Goodison.[101] Evertons record transfer paid was to Chelsea for Belgian forward Romelu Lukaku for a sum of 28m in 2014. Everton bought the player after he played the previous year with the team on loan. Everton hold the record for the most seasons in Englands top tier (Division One/Premier League), at 114 seasons out of 118 as of 201617 (the club played in Division 2 in 193031 and from 195154). They are one of six teams to have played in every season of the Premier League since its inception in August 1992 the others being Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester United, and Tottenham Hotspur. Everton against Aston Villa is the most played fixture in Englands top flight. As of the 201213 season, the two founding members of the Football League have played a record 196 league games.[102] Evertons community department, Everton in the Community (EitC), is a charity that provides sports and other social activities for the local community including for people with disabilities.[103] EitC represents the club in the European Multisport Club Association.[104] Everton have a link with Republic of Ireland football academy Ballyoulster United based in Celbridge,[105] Canadas Ontario Soccer Association,[106] and the Football Association of Thailand where they have a competition named the Chang-Everton cup which local schoolboys compete for.[107] The club also have a football academy in Limassol, Cyprus[108] and a partnership agreement with American club Pittsburgh Riverhounds.[109][110] The club also owned and operated a professional basketball team, by the name of Everton Tigers, who competed in the elite British Basketball League. The team was launched in the summer of 2007 as part of the clubs Community programme and played their home games at the Greenbank Sports Academy. The team was an amalgam of the Toxteth Tigers community youth programme, which started in 1968. The team quickly became one of the most successful in the league by winning the BBL Cup in 2009 and the play-offs in 2010. However, Everton withdrew funding before the 201011 season, and the team was re-launched as the Mersey Tigers.[111] Everton also have links with Chilean team Everton de Via del Mar who were named after the English club.[112][113] On 4 August 2010, the two Evertons played each other in a friendly named the Copa Hermandad at Goodison Park to mark the centenary of the Chilean team.[114] The occasion was organised by The Ruleteros Society, which is a society founded to promote connections between the two clubs.[115] Other Everton clubs exist in Rosario, Colonia in Uruguay,[116] La Plata and Ro Cuarto in Argentina,[117][118] Elk Grove, California in the United States,[119] and in Cork, Ireland.[120] Like all of the major clubs in England, Everton are referenced in many films, books, television programmes, songs and plays such as Boys from the Blackstuff, the Rutles All You Need Is Cash, Harry Enfields The Scousers and a 1979 television advertisement for ITVs ORACLE teletext service.[citation needed] The 1997 television film The Fix dramatised the true story of a match fixing scandal in which the clubs recent newly signed wing half Tony Kay, played by Jason Isaacs, is implicated in having helped to throw a match between his previous club Sheffield Wednesday and Ipswich Town. The majority of the story is set during Evertons 196263 League Championship winning season with then manager Harry Catterick played by Colin Welland.[121] First shown in 1969, the television movie The Golden Vision, directed by Ken Loach, combined improvised drama with documentary footage to tell of a group of Everton fans for whom the main purpose of life, following the team, is interrupted by such inconveniences as work and weddings. The films title character, celebrated forward Alex Young, was one of several who appeared as themselves.[122] In the 2015 film Creed, part of the Rocky franchise, Goodison Park features prominently and serves as the venue of climatic fight scene. Filming for this had been taken of the stadium and crowd during a match against West Bromwich Albion. Boxer Tony Bellew plays Creeds opponent Ricky Conlon and wears the Everton badge on his training gear and shorts. The club have entered the UK pop charts on four occasions under different titles during the 1980s and 1990s when many clubs released a song to mark their reaching the FA Cup Final. The Boys in Blue, released in 1984, peaked at number 82.[123] The following year the club scored their biggest hit when Here We Go peaked at 14.[124] In 1986 the club released Everybodys Cheering the Blues which reached number 83.[125] All Together Now, a reworking of a song by Merseyside band The Farm, was released for the 1995 FA Cup Final and reached number 27.[126] When the club next reached the 2009 FA Cup Final, the tradition had passed into history and no song was released.

English football. The club was founded in 1905 at the famous Crystal Palace Exhibition building by the owners of the FA Cup Final stadium which was situated inside its historic grounds. Palace played their home games at the Cup Final venue until 1915 when the First World War forced them to move out and play at Herne Hill Velodrome and The Nest. In 1924, the club moved to their current home at Selhurst Park. Palace have been FA Cup finalists twice, in 1990 and 2016, losing to Manchester United on both occasions. Palace were one of the original founding members of the Premier League. The club enjoyed their best ever top flight season in 199091, when they challenged for the English league title, eventually finishing in third place in the top tier, their highest ever league position. Palace were denied a place in Europe at the end of that season due to the partial UEFA ban on English clubs following the Heysel Stadium disaster. The club have been second tier champions twice and hold the record for the most play-off wins for promotion to the top flight, winning the final four times. Palace were also winners of the Full Members Cup in 1991 when they beat Everton in the Wembley final. In 1973, the club changed its original nickname from The Glaziers to The Eagles and introduced the red and blue vertical stripes now associated with the club. The club had previously played in claret and blue colours. Palace have rivalries with Brighton & Hove Albion, with whom they contest the M23 derby, and fellow South London clubs Millwall and Charlton Athletic.   In 1895, the Football Association had found a new permanent home for the FA Cup Final at the site of the famous Crystal Palace Exhibition building. Some years later the owners of the attraction, who were reliant on tourist activity for their income, sought fresh attractions for the venue, and decided to form their own football team to play at the Palace stadium. There had been an amateur Crystal Palace team as early as 1861, but they had disappeared from historical records around 1876. The owners of the venue wanted a professional club to play there and tap into the vast crowd potential of the area. Crystal Palace Football Club, originally nicknamed The Glaziers, was formed on 10 September 1905 under the guidance of Aston Villa assistant secretary Edmund Goodman.[3] The club applied to enter the Football League alongside another newly formed London club Chelsea. Unfortunately for Palace, it was Chelsea that were accepted and Palace found itself in the Southern League Second Division for the 190506 season. The club was successful in its inaugural season and was promoted to the First Division, crowned as champions.[3] In their first season Crystal Palace also played in the mid-week United Counties League, finishing runner-up to Watford, and it was in this competition that the club played their first match, winning 30 away to New Brompton.[3][4] Palace remained in the Southern League up until 1914, their one highlight the 1907 shock First Round victory over Newcastle United in the FA Cup.[5][6] The outbreak of the First World War led to the Admiralty requisitioning the Crystal Palace and the club was forced to move to the home of West Norwood F.C. at Herne Hill Velodrome.[3] Three years later the club moved again to the Nest due to the folding of Croydon Common F.C. The club joined the Football League Third Division in the 192021 season, finishing as champions and gaining promotion to the Second Division. During this period, Palace also won the London Challenge Cup three times in 1913, 1914, and 1921. Palace moved to the purpose-built stadium Selhurst Park in 1924, the ground the club plays at today.[3][7] The opening fixture at Selhurst Park was against Sheffield Wednesday, Palace losing 01 in front of a crowd of 25,000. Finishing in twenty-first position, the club was relegated to the Third Division South. Before the Second World War Palace made good efforts at promotion, never finishing outside the top half of the table and finishing second on three occasions. During the war years, the Football League was suspended, and the club won two Wartime Leagues, the South Regional League and the South D League. After the war, the club were less successful in the league, their highest position being seventh, and conversely on three occasions the club had to apply for re-election. The club remained in Division Three South until 195758. A league reorganisation would see clubs in the bottom half of the table merge with those in the bottom half of Division Three North to form a new Fourth Division. Palace finished fourteenth  just below the cut  and found itself in the basement of English football. Their stay proved brief. New chairman Arthur Wait appointed Arthur Rowe as manager, and the 196061 season saw Palace gain promotion. Palace also achieved distinction in 1962 when they played the great Real Madrid team of that era in a friendly match. This was the first time that the Spanish giants had played a match in London. Although Rowe then stepped down for health reasons towards the end of 1962, the promotion proved a turning point in the clubs history. Dick Graham and then Bert Head guided the club to successive promotions in 196364 and 196869, taking the club through the Second Division and into the heights of the First Division.[8] Palace stayed in the top flight from 1969 until 1973, but then experienced great disappointment. Under the management of Malcolm Allison the club was relegated in consecutive seasons, finding itself back in Division Three for the 197475 season. It was under Allison that the club became nicknamed The Eagles and they enjoyed a run to the semi-final of the 1975-76 FA Cup, beating Leeds and Chelsea along the way. Allison was sacked at the end of the 197576 campaign, and it was under Terry Venables management that Palace were promoted in 197677 and again in 197879, the latter saw the club crowned as Division Two champions. That team from 1979 was dubbed  The team of the Eighties and were briefly top of the whole Football League in the early part of the 197980 season, before financial difficulties suffered by the club caused the break up of that talented side, and this ultimately led to the club being unable to maintain their position in the top tier. They were relegated from the First Division in 198081, coinciding with Ron Noades takeover of the club. Steve Coppell arrived as manager on 4 June 1984, and under his stewardship and rebuilding the club achieved promotion via the play-offs back to the First Division in 198889. The club followed this up by reaching the 1990 FA Cup Final, drawing 33 with Manchester United in the first match but losing the replay 10. The club built on the success of the previous season in 199091 by achieving its highest league finish of third place in the top tier. Palace were denied a European place at the end of that season due to the partial UEFA ban on English clubs caused by the Heysel Stadium disaster. The club had also returned to Wembley to win the Full Members Cup. The club beat Everton 41 (after extra time) in the final.[3] The following season saw star striker Ian Wright leave the club for Arsenal. Palace finished tenth, allowing the club to become a founding member of the FA Premier League in 199293.[9] The club sold Mark Bright to Sheffield Wednesday the following season, but failed to rebuild the squad adequately, and Palace struggled to score throughout the season. The club found itself relegated with a total of 49 points, which is still a Premier League record for a relegated club. Steve Coppell resigned and Alan Smith, his assistant at the club, took over. His first season saw the club win the First Division title and gain promotion to the Premier League.[10] Their stay on this occasion proved eventful. On 25 January 1995, Palace played Manchester United at Selhurst Park in which Eric Cantona was sent off. He was taunted by Palace fan Matthew Simmons,[11] and retaliated with a flying kick.[12] Cantona was sentenced to two weeks in jail,[13] reduced to 120 hours community service on appeal. Simmons was immediately banned from Selhurst Park,[14] and found guilty on two charges of threatening Cantona.[15] More was to follow in March, when Chris Armstrong was suspended by the FA for failing a drugs test.[16] On the field, Alan Smith guided the club to the semi finals of both the FA Cup and the League Cup, but League form was a concern and Palace once again found itself relegated, finishing fourth from bottom as the Premier League reduced from 22 to 20 clubs.[17] Smith left the club and Steve Coppell returned as technical director in the summer of 1995, and through a combination of the first-team coaching of Ray Lewington and latterly Dave Bassetts managership Palace reached the play-offs. Palace lost the 1996 play off final in dramatic fashion, Steve Claridge scoring a last minute goal for Leicester City to win the tie 21. The following season saw Coppell take charge as first-team manager when Dave Bassett departed for Nottingham Forest in early 1997[18] The club was successful in the play-offs at the second time of asking when the club defeated Sheffield United in the final at Wembley.[19] This stay in the Premier League was no more successful than the previous two, and in true yo-yo club fashion the club was relegated back to the First Division for the 199899 season. The club competed in European competition during the summer when they played in the UEFA Intertoto Cup. Palace then went into administration in 1999, when owner Mark Goldberg was unable to sustain his financial backing of the club.[20] The club emerged from administration under the ownership of Simon Jordan, and Steve Coppell left the club, replaced by Alan Smith for a second time. The club were almost relegated in Jordans first season, in 200001. Smith was sacked in April and Steve Kember managed to win the two remaining fixtures that would guarantee survival, Dougie Freedman scoring the winner in a 10 victory over Stockport County in the 87th minute on the final day of the season. Steve Bruce was appointed manager for the 200102 season.[21] A good start to the season gave Palace hope for a promotion challenge, but Bruce attempted to walk out on the club after just four months at the helm to take charge of Birmingham City.[22][23] After a short spell on gardening leave,[24] Bruce was eventually allowed to join Birmingham,[25] succeeded by Trevor Francis, who had ironically been his predecessor at the Midlands club.[26] Under Francis, Palace finished mid-table for two successive seasons, and Francis left[27] to be replaced by long-serving coach Steve Kember.[28] Kember guided Palace to victories in their opening three games of the 200304 First Division campaign, which put Palace at the top of the table, but he was sacked in November after a terrible loss of form saw the team slip towards the relegation zone.[29] Iain Dowie was appointed manager and guided the club to the play-offs, securing promotion with a 10 victory over West Ham. Again Palace could not maintain their footing in the top tier and were relegated on the last day of the season after drawing at local rivals Charlton Athletic. Following that relegation, Simon Jordan was unable to put the club on a sound financial footing in the next few years, and in January 2010 the club was once again placed in administration, this time by a creditor.[30] The Football Leagues regulations saw the Eagles deducted ten points,[31] and the administrators was forced to sell key players including Victor Moses and Jos Fonte. Neil Warnock had also departed as manager in the early part of 2010. He had taken over as manager in 2007, replacing Peter Taylor who had a brief spell as manager. Paul Hart took over as caretaker manager for the final weeks of the season. Survival in the Championship was only secured on the final day of the season after a memorable 22 draw at Sheffield Wednesday, which was itself relegated as a result.[32] During the close season CPFC 2010, a consortium consisting of several wealthy fans successfully negotiated the purchase of the club. Led by Steve Parish, the vocal representative for a consortium of four that also included Stephen Browett, Jeremy Hosking and Martin Long. Crucially, CPFC 2010 also secured the freehold of the ground, the consortium paying tribute to a fans campaign which helped pressure Lloyds Bank into selling the ground back to the club. The consortium swiftly installed George Burley as the Eagles new manager.[33] However a poor start to the season saw the club hovering around the bottom of the table by December. On 1 January 2011, after a 30 defeat to Millwall, Burley was sacked and his assistant Dougie Freedman named caretaker manager. Freedman was appointed manager on a full-time basis on 11 January 2011.[34] Palace moved up the table and by securing a 11 draw at Hull City on 30 April, the club was safe from relegation with one game of the season left. After another year and a half as manager, Freedman departed to manage Bolton Wanderers on 23 October 2012.[35] In November 2012, Ian Holloway became the clubs manager. He guided Palace back to the Premier League after an 8-year absence by defeating Watford 10 in the Championship Play-Off Final at the new Wembley.[36] On 23 October 2013, Holloway left his post as manager on mutual consent terms.[37] This came after only managing one win in the first nine games of the 201314 season. Assistant manager Keith Millen was named caretaker manager while Palace searched for a new manager. On 23 November 2013, former Stoke City boss Tony Pulis was confirmed as the new manager of Crystal Palace.[38] On 19 April 2014, Crystal Palace ensured they were mathematically safe from relegation from the Premier League for the first time in five attempts. Pulis resigned on 14 August 2014, just two days before the start of the 201415 season and was replaced by Neil Warnock who returned to the club for a second spell as manager. However, Warnock was sacked by the club at Christmas after a poor run of results. On 2 January 2015, former Palace player Alan Pardew was confirmed as the new manager, signing a three-and-a-half-year contract with the club after a compensation package of 3.5 million was agreed with Newcastle United.[39] Pardew guided the club to comfortable mid-table safety and a third consecutive season in the Premier League. During the following season, Pardew led Palace to their first FA Cup Final for twenty-six years. Their opponents would be Manchester United again, who they lost to back in the 1990 final. But Palace would suffer disappointment again when they lost 21 after extra time. On 22 December 2016, Pardew was sacked by the club for its poor run of results in the start of the 201617 campaign. On 23 December 2016, Sam Allardyce was appointed as the new manager of the club under a two and a half year contract with immediate effect. On 26 December 2016, Allardyce took charge of his first match as manager of Crystal Palace against Watford, in which the result was a 11 draw. However, after a continuing run of poor form which saw Palace pick up only one league win in eight, the club remained in the relegation zone. Allardyces influence finally began to yield results beginning with a 1-0 home victory over Middlesbrough on 25 February 2017. The Eagles thus began an excellent run of form in which they achieved victories over Chelsea, Arsenal and Liverpool to pull themselves up the table. A trio of losses however - including a 2-0 home defeat against Burnley - made for a tense finale to the season. Palace secured their survival in emphatic style, though, with a 4-0 victory over Hull City on 14 May 2017, their last home game of the season. Allardyce resigned unexpectedly at the end of the season, citing a wish to spend time away from the game.[40] When Crystal Palace were founded in 1905, they turned to one of the biggest clubs in the country at the time, Aston Villa, to seek advice. Villa helped the club in a number of ways, not least by donating their kit.[41][42] As a result, Palaces colours were originally claret and blue shirts paired with white shorts, socks tending to be claret. They kept to this formula fairly consistently until 1938. The 193738 strip saw them try vertical stripes of claret and blue on the jersey rather than the claret body and blue sleeves, but in 1938 they decided to abandon the claret and blue and adopt white shirts and black shorts with matching socks. Although they returned to claret and blue from 1949 to 1954, the 1955 season saw them return to white and black, now using claret and blue as trim.[43] There were variations on this theme until 1963 when the club adopted the away strip of yellow jersey as the home colours. In 1964 the club adopted an all-white strip modelled on Real Madrid whom the club had played recently in a friendly, before they returned to claret and blue jerseys with white shorts in 1966. The club continued with variations on this theme up until Malcolm Allisons arrival as manager in 1973.[43] Allison overhauled the clubs image, adopting red and blue vertical stripes for colours and kit, inspired by Barcelona and Levante.[41] The club have played in variations of red and blue ever since, bar the centenary season of 2005 which saw them deploy a version of their 197172 claret, blue and white kit.[43] The club were relatively late in establishing a crest. Although the initials were embroidered onto the shirt from the 193536 season, a crest featuring the faade of The Crystal Palace did not appear until 1955. This crest disappeared from the shirt in 1964, and the teams name appeared embroidered on shirts in 196772. 1972 saw a round badge adopted with the clubs initials and nickname the Glaziers before Allison changed this too.[43] The nickname became the Eagles, inspired by Portuguese club Benfica, and the badge adopted an eagle holding a ball.[43] This emblem remained until 1987 when the club married the eagle with the Crystal Palace faade,[44] and although updated in 1996 and again in 2013 the crest retains these features.[43] Since mid-2010, the club has made use of an American bald eagle, called Kayla, as the club mascot, with the bird flying from one end of the stadium to the other at every home game.[45][46] Since 2014 Crystal Palaces kit has been manufactured by Macron. Previous manufacturers include Umbro (197577), Admiral (197780, 198788, 200304), Adidas (198083, 199699), Hummel (198487), Bukta (198892), Ribero (199294) Nutmeg (199496), TFG Sports (19992001) Le Coq Sportif (200103), Diadora (200407), Errea (200709), Nike (200912), and Avec (201214). The clubs shirts are currently sponsored (since 2015) by Mansion.com, and have previously been sponsored by Red Rose (198384), Top Score (198586), AVR (198687), Andrew Copeland (198788), Fly Virgin (198891), Tulip Computers (199193), TDK (199399), Churchill Insurance (200006), GAC Logistics (200614), and Neteller (201415).[43] In 1905, the Crystal Palace Company who owned the FA Cup Final venue situated inside the grounds of The Crystal Palace, wanted a professional club to play there and tap into the crowd potential of the area. They formed a new club called Crystal Palace F.C., to play at the stadium.[47] When the First World War broke out the Palace and grounds were seized by the armed forces, and in 1915 the club were forced to move by the Admiralty. They found a temporary base at the Herne Hill Velodrome. Although other clubs had offered the use of their ground to Palace, the club felt it best to remain as close to their natural catchment area as possible.[48] When Croydon Common F.C. were wound up in 1917, the club took over their old stadium at the Nest,[49] but in 1919 they began the purchase of the land on which they would eventually build Selhurst Park, their current home.[50] The renowned stadium architect, Archibald Leitch, was employed to draw up plans, and the club constructed and completed the ground in time for the 192425 season.[50] It remained relatively unchanged, with only the introduction of floodlights and maintenance and updating until 1969 when the Arthur Wait stand was constructed. The Main Stand became all-seater in 1979 and more work followed in the 1980s when the Whitehorse Lane End was redeveloped to allow for a Sainsburys supermarket, club offices and a club shop. The Arthur Wait stand became all seater in 1990, and in 1994 the Holmesdale Terrace was redeveloped, replaced with a two tier Stand. Selhursts attendance record was set in 1979, with an official total of 51,482.[51] After all the redevelopments to the ground and safety requirements due to the Taylor Report, the grounds current capacity is 26,309.[52] Proposals were put forward to move the club back to the Crystal Palace National Stadium in 2010,[53] but after the club gained promotion to the Premier League in 2013 there has been a renewed focus on redeveloping their current home into a 40,000 seater stadium.[52][54] Crystal Palace have a fan base drawn predominantly from the local area which draws on South London, Kent, and Surrey. The clubs original home, at The Crystal Palace, was on the boundary with Kent, while Selhurst Park was within Surreys borders until the London Government Act 1963 saw Greater London encompass Croydon. The clubs passionate support at home games emanates from the Holmesdale Road Stand, in which the ultras group the Holmesdale Fanatics have been based since 2005 . The fans have established at least two other supporters groups. The Palace Independent Supporters Association was set up to raise supporter concerns with the club,[55] while the Crystal Palace Supporters Trust was originally established to enable fans to purchase the club during the administration of 2000. The Trust remained in existence, and now lists one of its aims as building a new state-of-the-art training ground to lease to the Club.[56] A number of fanzines have been produced by the fans over the years. Eagle Eye launched in 1987 and ran until 1994, with a number of contributors launching the replacement Palace Echo in 1995, running until 2007.[57] The Eastern Eagles, So Glad Youre Mine and One More Point were also published by fans in the 1990s.[58] When One More Point ceased publication, Five Year Plan launched in its place,[59] and maintains an online presence.[60] Supporters also congregate on two internet forums, The BBS and Holmesdale.net which the club use as channels to communicate with fans.[61] Being a London club means they compete against a number of other local clubs for the attention of supporters but the club does have a recognisably large catchment area of 900,000.[54][62] When the new owners took control of the club in 2010, they sought the fans input into future decisions. They consulted on a new badge design, and when their chosen designs were rejected the club instead opted for a design based on a fans idea from an internet forum.[63] The club are also strengthening their ties with the local community, and through the Crystal Palace F.C. Foundation they work with local London boroughs of Croydon, Bromley and Sutton to provide sports and educational programmes. Through this work the club hope to develop their supporter base and geographical base. The Foundations work was recognised by the Football League in August 2009 with their Silver Standard Community Scheme Award.[64] The club also maintains a sizeable celebrity support. The Rolling Stones guitarist Bill Wyman has been an avid supporter of the club all his life. Kevin Day and Jo Brand host an annual comedy night for Comic Relief and the Palace Academy,[65] and the club also count fellow comedians Eddie Izzard, Harry Enfield, Sean Hughes, Mark Steel, Jim Piddock, and Roy Hudd amongst their fans. Film director Paul Greengrass is a self-confessed fan. The late Ronnie Corbett had also been a lifelong supporter of the club. The actor Neil Morrissey developed Palace Ale, a beer on sale in the ground,[66] while actor Bill Nighy is patron of the CPSCC, a Crystal Palace-based charity.[67] Two of the stars of The Inbetweeners, James Buckley and Simon Bird are also Palace fans.[68] Radio DJ David Jensen is chairman of the Crystal Palace Vice Presidents Club[69] and acted as spokesman for the CPFC 2010 consortium during their takeover bid for the club. Also, the heavy metal journalist Dave Ling is a passionate follower.[70] Actor, writer and producer John Salthouse was on the books of Crystal Palace from 1968 to 1970,[71] and was also a mascot for the club as a child.[72] He incorporated the club into his role as Tony in Abigails Party he was under the name of John Lewis at Palace.[73] Susanna Reid revealed her love of Palace while taking part in Strictly Come Dancing, visiting Selhurst Park for inspiration.[74] Rebecca Lowe, currently the host of Premier League coverage for NBC Sports, is also a supporter.[75] Due to their location in the capital, Crystal Palace are involved in a number of local derbies, mostly across South London. They enjoy rivalries with both Millwall and former tenants Charlton Athletic. They have a fierce rivalry with Brighton & Hove Albion which did not develop until Palaces relegation to the Third Division in 1974, reaching its height when the two teams were drawn together in the first round of the 197677 FA Cup. The game went to two replays, but the controversy was based on referee Ron Challis ordering a successful Brighton penalty be retaken because of Palace player encroachment. The retake was saved, Palace won the game 10 and a fierce rivalry was born.[76] Due to the Football League not wishing the owners of the FA Cup Final to also own a team, a separate company was established to found and own the team. The first chairman, Sydney Bourne, was found by club secretary Edmund Goodman after he had examined records of FA Cup Final ticket purchasers. Goodman noted his name as one that had bought a number of tickets every year, and so he met with Bourne and found him very agreeable to the idea of the new club. Bourne was invited onto the board of directors and elected chairman at the clubs first ever meeting. Bourne remained chairman until his death in 1930.[77] Arthur Wait established a consortium of seven businessmen to purchase the club in 1949, and initially they rotated the chairmanship.[78][79] In 1958 Wait became the Chairman, before being replaced by Raymond Bloye in 1972.[80] Bloyes ownership lasted until 26 January 1981, when property developer Ron Noades and his small consortium took control of the club. Noades eventually sold the club to Mark Goldberg on 5 June 1998, becoming the second longest serving chairman behind Sydney Bourne. Goldbergs tenure of the club was not a success and the club entered administration in March 1999. Although the fans established a group, the Crystal Palace Supporters Trust in a bid to gain control of the club, millionaire Simon Jordan negotiated a deal with creditors and the administrator, and a new company, CPFC 2000 took control. This company entered administration in January 2010, leaving administration in June of that year after a takeover by a consortium of four wealthy fans, CPFC 2010.[81] CPFC 2010 was established by a consortium of four businessmen, Steve Parish, Martin Long, Stephen Browett and Jeremy Hosking in 2010, with each owning a 25 share of the company.[82][83] The four successfully negotiated a take-over with the administrator Brendan Guilfoyle and a company voluntary arrangement was formally accepted by company creditors on 20 August 2010.[84] CPFC 2010 also purchased the ground from Lloyds Bank after a demonstration by fans put pressure on the bank to agree terms.[85][86] On 18 December 2015, it was announced that a new deal had been signed with American investors Josh Harris and David Blitzer.[87] The club stated that Steve Parish would continue as chairman alongside Harris and Blitzer as general partners in a new structure, and that Browett, Long and Hosking would also retain a substantial investment.[88] Later company accounts showed that the ownership figures were: Steve Parish 18, Steve Browett 5, Jeremy Hosking 5 and Martin Long 2.5 with the remainder being owned by Palace Holdco LP (a limited partnership registered in Delaware) 67.5 and Palace Parallel LLC (a company also registered in Delaware) 1.5. Both Palace Holdco and Palace Parallel have 180 preference shares each. As the Delaware companies do not have to reveal their owners the exact ownership of the club is therefore unknown but Steve Parish confirmed that each of Harris and Blitzer had an 18 share to match his own. Jim Cannon holds the record for Crystal Palace appearances, having played 660 first-team matches between 1973 and 1988.[89] He also holds the record for most League appearances, making 571.[90] Cannon joined the club as a trainee, and of his appearances only four of them were made as a substitute. His first appearance was made aged 19, scoring in a home win against Chelsea on 31 March 1973. Cannons last game was on 7 May 1988, a home win against Manchester City.[91] Peter Simpson holds the record for the most goals scored in a season, 54 in the 193031 season in Division Three (South). Simpson, who signed for the club from Kettering Town, is also the top scorer over a career  165 between 1929 and 1935.[89] Mile Jedinak holds the club record for most international caps, with 37 appearances for Australia while at Palace.[90][92][93] Crystal Palace hold a number of records and achievements. They are one of only a small group of clubs to have been inaugural champions of a Football League Division, winning the newly formed Third Division in 192021. Their average league attendance of 19,092 achieved in the 196061 season and the attendance of 37,774 for the Good Friday game at Selhurst Park between Palace and Millwall the same season are Fourth Division attendance records.[94] The clubs widest victory margin in the league was their 90 win against Barrow in the Fourth Division in 1959, while their heaviest defeat in the league was by the same scoreline, 90, against Liverpool in 1989 in Division One.[95] Palaces record home attendance is 51,482 for a Division Two match against Burnley, achieved on 11 May 1979.[95] With the introduction of regulations enforcing all-seater stadiums, it is unlikely that this record will be beaten in the foreseeable future. The highest transfer fee received for a Palace player is 28million, from Everton for Yannick Bolasie in August 2016, while the highest transfer fee paid by the club to date was for Christian Benteke from Liverpool also in August 2016, for 32 million. The clubs highest ever league finish so far is third place in the Football League First Division which is now called the Premier League achieved in 199091, under the management of Steve Coppell. The club have been FA Cup finalists twice in 1990 and 2016, finishing runners-up on both occasions and have also reached the semi-finals on two other occasions. Palace have reached the semi-finals of the League Cup four times, most recently in 2012. The club were winners of the Full Members Cup in 1991. Palace were relegated in the 199293 season on 49 points which is still a Premier League record number of points for a relegated club. Palace also remain the only team ever to be relegated from the Premier League even though they finished fourth from bottom in the 199495 season. This was because it had been decided that the following season would see the Premier League reduced from 22 teams down to the current standard of 20. Palace hold the record for relegations from the Premier League along with Sunderland, Middlesbrough and Norwich City with a total of 4, (199293, 199495, 199798, 200405), but conversely they also hold the record for most Play off wins resulting in promotion to the top flight amassing 4 Play off victories, and they hold the record (in any division) for winning promotion via the Play offs at 4 different locations, (Selhurst Park 1989, Old Wembley 1997, Millennium Stadium 2004 and New Wembley 2013). Note: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules. Players may hold more than one non-FIFA nationality. Crystal Palace Reserves joined the London League in the year 190607. Crystal Palace has gained a reputation for their academy which produced players such as Wilfried Zaha, Nathaniel Clyne, Victor Moses, Wayne Routledge, Ben Watson, Clinton Morrison, Gareth Southgate etc.[99][100] Note: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules. Players may hold more than one non-FIFA nationality. To celebrate Crystal Palaces centenary in 2005, the club asked Palace fans to vote for a Centenary XI from a shortlist of ten players per position, provided by the club.[101] Crystal Palaces honours and achievements include the following; In the 1999 Michael Winterbottom film Wonderland the scenes of the character Dan and his son at a football match were filmed at Selhurst Park, the ground of Crystal Palace, in a 11 draw against Birmingham City on 6 February 1999.[104] In the Mike Leigh play Abigails Party, the character Tony mentions that he used to play professionally for Crystal Palace but it didnt work out, something actor John Salthouse brought to the character in rehearsals based on his own life.[73] Salthouse also incorporated the club into the childrens television series he wrote, Hero to Zero, in which the father of the main character once played for Palace reserves.[105] In the first series of Only Fools and Horses a Crystal Palace scarf could be seen on the coat rack, placed there by producer Ray Butt, even though Rodneys middle name was Charlton, as Del revealed on Rodneys wedding day: their mother was a fan of Athletic not Heston.[106] Headmaster Keith Blackwell, who played Crystal Palace mascot Pete the Eagle in the late nineties, fronted a series of Coca-Cola advertisements in 1996. Blackwell spoke about his role and the embarrassment it brought to his family, and clips of him in costume were used in the campaign.[107][108] Crystal Palace Ladies is the womens football club affiliated to Crystal Palace, founded in 1992. They are managed by Dean Davenport. Crystal Palace Ladies FA Womens Premier League South, in the third tier of English womens football.[109] They play their home games at the Hayes Lane, Bromley, London.[109]

in the Premier League, the top tier of the English football league system. Formed in 1890 as Boscombe St. Johns Institute F.C., the club was reformed in 1899 as Boscombe F.C.. They changed to Bournemouth and Boscombe Athletic F.C. in 1923, before settling on their current name in 1972. Nicknamed The Cherries, since 1910 Bournemouth have played their home games at Dean Court. Their home colours are red and black striped shirts, with black shorts and socks. AFC Bournemouth have won the second and third tiers of English football, and were twice runners up of the fourth tier. They have also won the Football League Trophy, and the Football League Third Division South Cup. Bournemouth have spent most of their history in the third tier of football. Under manager Eddie Howe, they have risen through the pyramid; the 201516 season was AFC Bournemouths first ever in Englands top division.   Although the exact date of the clubs foundation is not known, there is proof that it was formed in the autumn of 1899 out of the remains of the older Boscombe St. Johns Lads Institute F.C.[2] The club was originally known as Boscombe F.C. The first president was Mr. J. C. Nutt.[3] In their first season, 18991900, Boscombe F.C. competed in the Bournemouth and District Junior League. They also played in the Hants Junior Cup. During the first two seasons, they played on a football pitch in Castlemain Avenue, Pokesdown. From their third season, the team played on a pitch in Kings Park. In the 190506 season, Boscombe F.C. graduated to senior amateur football.[4] In 1910, the club was granted a long lease upon some wasteland next to Kings Park as the clubs football ground by President J. E. Cooper-Dean. With their own ground, named Dean Court after the benefactor, the club continued to thrive and dominated the local football scene. Also in 1910, the club signed their first professional football player B. Penton. Around about this time, the club obtained their nickname The Cherries, with two foremost tales on how the club gained the nickname. First, because of the cherry-red striped shirts that the team played in and, perhaps less plausible, because Dean Court was built adjacent to the Cooper-Dean estate, which, it is believed may have encompassed numerous cherry orchards. For the first time, during the 191314 season, the club competed in the FA Cup. The clubs progress, however, was halted in 1914 with the outbreak of World War I, and Boscombe F.C. returned to the Hampshire League. In 1920, the Third Division of the Football League was formed, and Boscombe were promoted to the rump Southern League, finding moderate success. To make the club more representative of the district, the name was changed to Bournemouth and Boscombe Athletic F.C. in 1923. During the same year, the club was elected to the newly-expanded Football League Third Division (South). The first league match was at Swindon Town on 25 August 1923, which Bournemouth lost 31. The first league game at Dean Court was also against Swindon, where Bournemouth gained their first league point after a 00 draw. Initially, Bournemouth struggled in the Football League but eventually established themselves as a Third Division club. Bournemouth remains on the records as the longest continuous members of the Third Division. As a league club, Bournemouth had to wait until after the Second World War before winning their first trophy. This was accomplished as they beat Walsall in the Third Division (South) Cup in the final at Stamford Bridge. Under manager John Bond, the club adopted the more streamlined AFC Bournemouth name in 1972. At the same time, the club adopted a new badge as a symbol of the clubs progress. The stripes in the background were based on the club shirt, while in the foreground is the profile of a player heading the ball, in honour of Dickie Dowsett, a prolific scorer for the club in the 1950s and 1960s.[5] Their red and black kit, introduced in 1971, was based on the Milan strip.[citation needed] This was the era of Ted MacDougall, a prolific goalscorer who, in an FA Cup tie in November 1971, scored nine goals in an 110 win against Margate. The club recorded a famous victory over holders Manchester United in the FA Cup in January 1984, while they were managed by Harry Redknapp.[6][7] Redknapp took Bournemouth into the second tier of the English league for the first time in their history as Third Division champions in 1987. After comfortably surviving in their first season in the Second Division, Bournemouth made a serious challenge for promotion to the top flight in the 198889 season; they ultimately fell away after a poor run late in the season, but their eventual finish of 12th place remained their highest-ever in the Football League until the 201314 season. On 5 May 1990, the final day of the 198990 season, Leeds United had the chance to win the Second Division and gain promotion into the First Division by beating Bournemouth at Dean Court. Some United fans had already caused trouble in the town during the morning and the atmosphere was tense as Leeds won the match by a single goal. Combined with the results of other matches, this meant that Leeds were promoted while Bournemouth were relegated. The violence and destruction by visitors to Bournemouth continued over the holiday weekend, causing more than 1 million worth of damage and injury to opposing fans and police officers.[8] The towns Daily Echo newspaper reported that spectators, including many young children, had to run to safety as missiles were hurled and riot police waded in to control the crowds.[8] The matter was raised in Parliament by one of the towns MPs. Financially, the Leeds trouble affected the club for more than a decade, as Bournemouth were prevented by local police from staging home games on Bank Holidays (traditionally a popular day for football) until a game against Shrewsbury Town on 21 April 2003. Redknapp remained at the club for two more seasons, both of which ended with the club falling three points short of the play-offs. However, mounting financial pressures caused him to resign his position at the end of the 199192 season, and he subsequently rejoined former club West Ham United as a coach. He was replaced by Tony Pulis, who built a much cheaper squad that could only manage two consecutive 17th-place finishes before Pulis walked out of the club, blaming financial pressures much as his predecessor had done. Bournemouth went the first few months of the 199495 season without a permanent manager in place, and a dreadful start saw them bottom of the table for much of the first half of the season. Despite a minor upturn in form when Mel Machin was appointed as manager, they looked highly unlikely to survive, given that there were five relegation spots in Division Two for that season due to league reconstruction. However, a late run of form combined with collapses by relegation rivals Cambridge United and Plymouth Argyle saw them survive on the last day of the season by just two points. Machin ultimately remained in charge for six years, most of which were marked by unremarkable mid-table finishes. The 199899 season proved to be arguably the highlight of his tenure, with the club making a serious play-off challenge for most of the season, but ultimately falling short and finishing seventh. However, a drop to 16th place in the 19992000 season followed by a bad start to the following season saw Machin removed from his position and given the role of director of football. Sean ODriscoll was promoted from the coaching staff in place of Mel Machin at the start of the 200001 season. In ODriscolls first season as manager, Bournemouth narrowly missed out on the Division Two playoffs, but were relegated a year later in the new stadium. The board kept faith in ODriscoll and they were rewarded with promotion via the Division Three playoffs in 200203. The club became the first to score five goals at the Millennium Stadium when they beat Lincoln City 25 in the 200203 Division Three play-off final with goals from Steve Fletcher, Carl Fletcher (2), Stephen Purches and Garreth OConnor. Under ODriscoll, Bournemouth narrowly missed out on the play-offs for the 200304 and 200405 seasons, and just avoided relegation in the 200506 season. Long-serving player James Hayter scored the fastest league hat-trick in English Football League history during the 200304 season. The Cherries were leading 30 against Wrexham thanks to goals from Stephen Purches, Warren Cummings and Warren Feeney when Hayter was brought onto the field as a substitute. With 86 minutes gone, Hayter managed to net three goals in the space of two minutes and 17 seconds, making the final score 60 to Bournemouth. In September 2006, with the team in eighth in the League, Sean ODriscoll left to become manager of Doncaster Rovers. He was replaced by Kevin Bond. In February 2008, Bournemouth were forced into administration, suffering a ten-point deduction which put them in relegation trouble. Bournemouth had debts of around 4 million and almost went out of business completely.[9] The off-field uncertainty continued throughout the season, with only one, ultimately unsuccessful, bid for the club accepted,[10] and the club ended the season being relegated to League Two. Ahead of the 200809 season, the teams future in the Football League was put into doubt when the league threatened to block Bournemouths participation in League Two, due to problems with the teams continuing administration and change in ownership. It ordered both Bournemouth and Rotherham United to demonstrate that they could fulfil all of their fixtures and find a way out of administration,[11] eventually allowing the club to compete with a 17-point penalty for failing to follow the Football League insolvency rules. The new company was also ordered to pay unsecured creditors the amount offered at the time of the original C.V.A. (around ten pence in the pound) within two years.[12] Early into the season, manager Bond was sacked and was replaced by former player Jimmy Quinn, who would himself leave the club only a few months later.[13] Former player Eddie Howe took over as manager with the club still ten points adrift at the bottom of the league and initially on a caretaker basis, becoming the youngest manager in the Football League at the age of 31.[14] At the end of 2008, it was announced that local businessman Adam Murry had completed the purchase of 50 of the clubs shares from previous chairman Paul Baker. However, in January 2009, Murry missed the deadline to buy Bakers shares.[15] In the final home game of the 200809 season, the Cherries guaranteed their Football League status by beating Grimsby Town 21 with a winning goal ten minutes from time by Bournemouth legend Steve Fletcher, sparking wild celebrations after a fairytale ending to The Great Escape. They finished their troubled season with their best away win in 30 years with a 04 victory at Morecambe. In June 2009, a consortium including Adam Murry finally took over AFC Bournemouth. The consortium included Jeff Mostyn, former vice-chairman Steve Sly, Neill Blake and former Dorchester Town chairman Eddie Mitchell. Howes first full season in charge brought success as Bournemouth finished second in League Two to earn promotion with two games to spare. Howe subsequently left the club for Burnley during the following season; his successor, another former Bournemouth player, Lee Bradbury, led Bournemouth to the League One play-offs. The two-legged semi-final against Huddersfield Town finished 33 after extra time, and Huddersfield went through the final by winning the penalty shoot-out 42. Bradbury was unable to lead Bournemouth to another promotion challenge in the 201112 Football League One, placing 11th after a season of indifferent results, and was replaced by youth team coach Paul Groves for the final games of the season. Groves remained in charge at the start of the 201213 season, only to be sacked in October 2012 following a start which left the club near the bottom of the table. Eddie Howe returned as manager, and not only did he pull the club away from their early-season relegation battle, they achieved promotion to the Championship, returning to the second-tier of English football for the first time since 1990. The club also revealed a new club crest.[16] After a promising start to life in the Championship, the club was handed a fourth Round FA Cup tie with Premier League club Liverpool which ended in a 20 loss. Bournemouth finished their first season back in the Championship in tenth place, their highest ever position in the Football League. On 25 October 2014, Bournemouth won 80 away at St. Andrews against Birmingham City. It was the first time that the Cherries had ever scored eight goals in a league game and their largest winning margin in the league (barring a 100 win over Northampton Town in September 1939, which was discounted after the league was abandoned due to the Second World War).[17] The club followed up this success with a 21 victory over Premier League side West Bromwich Albion in the League Cup, reaching the quarter-finals of the competition for the first time. Bournemouth were again drawn against Liverpool but lost 31. The club spent most of the 201415 season near the top of the table, and a 03 win away at Charlton Athletic on the final day of the season was enough to clinch the Championship title and a first ever promotion to the top flight of English football.[18] AFC Bournemouths first ever game in the top flight of English football was a 10 defeat home to Aston Villa played on 8 August 2015. Early on in the 201516 season the team was beset by a number of crippling injuries, including to their captain, Tommy Elphick and their star striker from the previous season, Callum Wilson, the latter of which was injured for the majority of the season. The team struggled for most of the first half of the season until a turning point was reached during a game at Dean Court against Everton in which Junior Stanislas scored a goal in the seventh minute of stoppage time to tie the game. From there, AFC Bournemouth defeated Chelsea and Manchester United in back-to-back wins. The team eventually finished 16th in the league, securing their Premier League status for another year.

[21] The teams colours have varied slightly throughout the clubs history. Starting off playing in red and white stripes, Bournemouth have also played in all-red shirts, red with white sleeves, and mostly, since 1990, in red and black stripes, similar to that of Milan.[22] A predominantly red shirt was chosen for the 200405 and 200506 seasons before a return to the stripes for the 200607 season due to fan demand.[23] Since 2015 AFC Bournemouths kit has been manufactured by JD Sports. Previously it has been made by Umbro (197478, 198386), Adidas (197881), Osca (198283), Henson (198687), Scoreline (198790), Ellgren (199092), Matchwinner (199395), Le Coq Sportif (199596), Patrick (19962000), Super League (200-01), TFG Sportswear (200103), Bourne Red (200308), Carbrini Sportswear (200811, 201415) and Fila (201114).

football, after winning the Championship title in 2017. Newcastle United was founded in 1892 by the merger of Newcastle East End and Newcastle West End, and has played at its current home ground, St James Park, ever since. The ground was developed into an all-seater stadium in the mid-1990s and now has a capacity of 52,354.[2][3] The club has been a member of the Premier League for all but three years of the competitions history, spending 85 seasons in the top tier as of May 2016, and has never dropped below English footballs second tier since joining the Football League in 1893. They have won four League Championship titles, six FA Cups and a Charity Shield, as well as the 1969 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup and the 2006 UEFA Intertoto Cup. Newcastle United has the ninth highest total of trophies won by an English club.[4] The clubs most successful period was between 1904 and 1910, when they won an FA Cup and three of their First Division titles. The club were highly successful in the Premier League in the 1990s and early 2000s without winning any trophies, but have been mostly struggling since the 200607 season, and were relegated in 2009 and 2016. Newcastle has a fierce local rivalry with Sunderland, and the two clubs have engaged in the TyneWear derby since 1898. The clubs traditional kit colours are black and white striped shirts, black shorts and black socks. Their traditional crest takes elements of the city coat of arms, which features two grey seahorses. Prior to each home game the team enters the field to Local Hero, written by Newcastle native Mark Knopfler, while Blaydon Races is invariably sung during games.[5] The club has been owned by Mike Ashley since 2007, succeeding long term chairman and owner Sir John Hall. The club is the seventeenth highest revenue producing club in the world in terms of annual revenue, generating 169.3m in 2015. Historically, Newcastles highest placing was in 1999 when they were the fifth highest revenue producing football club in the world, and second in England only behind Manchester United.[6]   The first record of football being played on Tyneside dates from 3 March 1877 at Elswick Rugby Club. Later that year, Newcastles first football club, Tyne Association, was formed. The origins of Newcastle United Football Club itself can be traced back to the formation of a football club by the Stanley Cricket Club of Byker in November 1881. This team was renamed Newcastle East End F.C. in October 1882, to avoid confusion with the cricket club in Stanley, County Durham. Rosewood F.C. of Byker merged with Newcastle East End a short time later. In 1886, Newcastle East End moved from Byker to Heaton. In August 1882, Newcastle West End F.C. formed from West End Cricket Club, and in May 1886, the club moved into St James Park.[7] The two clubs became rivals in the Northern League. In 1889, Newcastle East End became a professional team, before becoming a limited company the following March.[8] However, on the other hand, Newcastle West End were in serious financial trouble and approached East End with a view to a take over. Newcastle West End were eventually dissolved, and a number of their players and backroom staff joined Newcastle East End, effectively merging the two clubs, with Newcastle East End taking over the lease on St James Park in May 1892.[7] With only one senior club in the city for fans to support, development of the club was much more rapid. Despite being refused entry to the Football Leagues First Division at the start of the 189293 season, they were invited to play in their new Second Division. However, with no big names playing in the Second Division, they turned down the offer and remained in the Northern League, stating gates would not meet the heavy expenses incurred for travelling.[7][8] In a bid to start drawing larger crowds, Newcastle East End decided to adopt a new name in recognition of the merger.[7] Suggested names included Newcastle F.C., Newcastle Rangers, Newcastle City and City of Newcastle, but Newcastle United was decided upon on 9 December 1892, to signify the unification of the two teams.[7][9] The name change was accepted by the Football Association on 22 December, but the club was not legally constituted as Newcastle United Football Club Co. Ltd. until 6 September 1895.[8] At the start of the 189394 season, Newcastle United were once again refused entry to the First Division and so joined the Second Division, along with Liverpool and Woolwich Arsenal.[7] They played their first competitive match in the division that September against Woolwich Arsenal, with a score of 22.[8] Turnstile numbers were still low, and the incensed club published a statement stating, The Newcastle public do not deserve to be catered for as far as professional football is concerned. However, eventually figures picked up by 189596, when 14,000 fans watched the team play Bury. That season Frank Watt became secretary of the club, and he was instrumental in promotion to the First Division for the 189899 season. However, they lost their first game 42 at home to Wolves and finished their first season in thirteenth place.[8] In 190304, the club built up a promising squad of players, and went on to dominate English football for almost a decade, the team known for their artistic play, combining team-work and quick, short passing. Long after his retirement, Peter McWilliam, the teams defender at the time, said The Newcastle team of the 1900s would give any modern side a two goal start and beat them, and further more, beat them at a trot. Newcastle United went on to win the League on three occasions during the 1900s; 190405, 190607 and 190809.[8][10] In 190405, they nearly did the double, losing to Aston Villa in the 1905 FA Cup Final. They were beaten again the following year by Everton in the 1906 FA Cup Final. They reached the final again in 1908 where they lost to Wolves. They finally won the FA Cup in 1910 when they beat Barnsley in the final. They lost again the following year in the final against Bradford City.[8] The team returned to the FA Cup final in 1924, in the second final held at the then new Wembley Stadium. They defeated Aston Villa, winning the clubs second FA Cup.[8] Three years later they won the First Division championship a fourth time in 192627, with Hughie Gallacher, one of the most prolific goal scorers in the clubs history, captaining the team. Other key players in this period were Neil Harris, Stan Seymour and Frank Hudspeth. In 1930, Newcastle United came close to relegation, and at the end of the season Gallacher left the club for Chelsea, and at the same time Andy Cunningham became the clubs first team manager. In 193132, the club won the FA Cup a third time. However, a couple of years later, at the end of the 193334 season, the team were relegated to the Second Division after 35 seasons in the top. Cunningham left as manager and Tom Mather took over.[8] The club found it difficult to adjust to the Second Division and were nearly further relegated in the 193738 season, when they were spared on goal averages. However, when World War II broke in 1939, Newcastle had a chance to regroup, and in the War period, they brought in Jackie Milburn, Tommy Walker and Bobby Cowell. They were finally promoted back to the First Division at the end of the 194748 season.[8] During the 1950s, Newcastle won the FA Cup trophy on three occasions within a five-year period, beating Blackpool in 1951, Arsenal in 1952, and Manchester City in 1955. However, after this last FA Cup victory the club fell back into decline and were relegated to the Second Division once again at the end of the 196061 season under the management of Charlie Mitten. Mitten left after one season in the Second Division and was replaced by former player Joe Harvey. Newcastle returned to the First Division at the end of the 196465 season after winning the Second Division title.[8] Under Harvey, the club qualified for European competition for the first time after a good run in the 196768 season and the following year won the 1969 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup Final, triumphing 62 over two legs against Hungarys jpest in the final.[8] Harvey bought striker Malcolm Macdonald in the summer of 1971, for a club record transfer fee of 180,000.[8][11] He was an impressive goal scorer, who led Uniteds attack to Wembley in their 1974 FA Cup Final defeat at the hands of Liverpool.[8] The club also had back to back triumphs in the Texaco Cup in 1974 and 1975.[12] Harvey left the club in 1975, with Gordon Lee brought in to replace him. Lee took the team to the 1976 Football League Cup Final against Manchester City, but failed to bring the trophy back to Tyneside. However, he sold Macdonald to Arsenal at the end of the season, a decision of which Macdonald later said I loved Newcastle, until Gordon Lee took over. Lee left for Everton in 1977, and was replaced by Richard Dinnis.[8] United dropped once again to the Second Division at the end of the 197778 season. Dinnis was replaced by Bill McGarry, and then he was replaced by Arthur Cox. Cox steered Newcastle back to the First Division at the end of the 198384 season, with players such as Peter Beardsley, Chris Waddle, and ex-England captain Kevin Keegan the fulcrum of the team. However, with a lack of funds, Cox left for Derby County and Keegan retired. With managers such as Jack Charlton and then Willie McFaul, Newcastle remained in the top-flight, until key players such as Waddle, Beardsley and Paul Gascoigne were sold, and the team was relegated once more in 1989. McFaul left the managerial post, and was replaced by Jim Smith. Smith left at the start of the 199192 season and the board appointed Osvaldo Ardiles his replacement.[8] Sir John Hall became the clubs chairman in 1992, and replaced Ardiles with Keegan, who managed to save the team from relegation to the Third Division. Keegan was given more money for players, and he brought in Rob Lee, Paul Bracewell and Barry Venison and the club won the then First Division Championship at the end of the 199293 season, earning promotion to the then new Premier League. At the end of the 199394 season, their first year back in the top flight they finished in third, their highest league finish since 1927.[8] The attacking philosophy of Keegan led to the team being labelled The Entertainers by Sky Sports.[13] Keegan took Newcastle to two consecutive runners-up finishes in the league in 199596 and 199697, coming very close to winning the title in the former season. This success was in part due to the talent of players like David Ginola, Les Ferdinand and Alan Shearer, who was signed on 30 July 1996 for a then world record fee of 15million. Keegan left Newcastle in January 1997 and was replaced by Kenny Dalglish, however the club endured a largely unsuccessful season with a 13th-place finish in the 199798 FA Premier League, failure to progress beyond the group stages of the 199798 UEFA Champions League despite beating Barcelona and group winners Dynamo Kiev at St James Park as well as coming from 20 down to draw 22 with Valery Lobanovskys team in Ukraine and defeat in the 1998 FA Cup Final. Dalglish was replaced as manager early in the following season by Ruud Gullit.[14][15] The club once again finished thirteenth in the league and lost the 1999 FA Cup Final. Gullit fell into disagreements with the squad and chairman Freddy Shepherd, and quit the club four games into the 19992000 season with the team bottom of the table to be replaced by Bobby Robson.[15][16] The club managed to reach an FA Cup Semi-final and to stay in the Premier League. A title challenge emerged during the 200102 season, and Newcastles fourth-place finish saw them qualify for the Champions League. The following season, Robson guided the team to another title challenge and finished third in the League, and the second group stage of the Champions League.[17] Newcastle finished fifth in the league at the end of the 200304 season, and exited the Champions League in the qualifying rounds, but despite this Robson was sacked in August 2004 following a series of disagreements with the club.[18][19] Graeme Souness was brought in to manage by the start of the 200405 season. In his time at the helm, he broke the clubs transfer record by signing Michael Owen. Souness also took the geordies to the quarterfinals of the 2005 UEFA Cup with Alan Shearer winning the tournaments golden boot as well.[20][21] [22] However, he was sacked in February 2006 after a bad start to the clubs 200506 season.[23] Glenn Roeder took over, initially on a temporary basis, before being appointed full-time manager at the end of the season.[24] Shearer retired at the end of the 200506 season as the clubs all-time record goal scorer, with a total of 206 goals. Despite finishing the 200506 season in seventh, Roeders fortunes changed in the 200607 season, with a terrible injury run to the senior squad, and he left the club by mutual consent on 6 May 2007.[25] Sam Allardyce was appointed Roeders replacement as manager on 15 May 2007.[26] On 7 June, Freddy Shepherds final shares in the club were sold to Mike Ashley and Shepherd was replaced as chairman by Chris Mort on 25 July.[27][28] Allardyce departed the club on in January 2008 by mutual consent after a bad start to the 200708 season,[29] and Kevin Keegan was reappointed as Newcastle manager.[30] Mort stepped down as chairman in June and was replaced by Derek Llambias, a long-term associate of Ashley.[31] Newcastle finished the 200708 season in twelfth place, but as the season drew to a close, Keegan publicly criticised the board, claiming they were not providing the team enough financial support.[32] In September 2008 Keegan resigned as manager, stating Its my opinion that a manager must have the right to manage and that clubs should not impose upon any manager any player that he does not want.[33] Former Wimbledon manager Joe Kinnear was appointed as his replacement,[34] but in February 2009, due to his heart surgery, Alan Shearer was appointed interim manager in his absence.[35] Under Shearer, the club were relegated to the Football League Championship at the end of the 200809 season, the first time the club had left the Premier League since joining it in 1993.[36] Following their relegation, the club was put up for sale in June 2009, with an asking price of 100million.[37] Chris Hughton was given the manager job on a caretaker basis before taking over full-time on 27 October 2009.[38] On the same day, Ashley announced that the club was no longer for sale.[39] Hughton led Newcastle to win the 200910 Football League Championship, securing automatic promotion on 5 April 2010 with five games remaining, and securing the title on 19 April; Newcastle were promoted back to the Premier League after just one season away.[40][41][42] Under Hughton, Newcastle enjoyed a strong start to the 201011 season, but he was sacked on 6 December 2010. The clubs board stated that they felt an individual with more managerial experience [was] needed to take the club forward.[43] Three days later, Alan Pardew was appointed as manager with a five-and-a-half-year contract.[44][45] Further controversy was caused on 31 January 2011, when striker Andy Carroll was sold to Liverpool for a club record of 35million.[46] Despite this turbulence, Newcastle were able to finish 12th at the end of the season, with one particular highlight being a 44 home draw against Arsenal that saw Newcastle come back from four goals down to claim a point.[47] The start of the 201112 season saw an overhaul in the first team, with the sale of influential first team players Kevin Nolan,[48] Joey Barton[49] and Jos Enrique[50] during the summer and the elevation of Tim Krul as first choice goalkeeper and centre back Fabricio Coloccini as captain. Signings such as Yohan Cabaye,[51] Italian international Davide Santon[52] and Senegalese striker Demba Ba[53] in cut-price deals saw Newcatle adopt a new transfer policy, one which would be met with success in the season. They went on to enjoy one of their strongest openings to a season, playing 11 consecutive games unbeaten.[54] before losing away to Manchester City.[55] Another Senegalese striker, Papiss Ciss, joined in the January transfer window, and Newcastle had a strong second half of the season, eventually securing a place in the 201213 Europa League.[56] Newcastle finished in fifth place, their highest league position since the Bobby Robson days. Further honours were to come as Pardew won both the Premier League Manager of the Season[57] and the LMA Manager of the Year awards, captain Coloccini was named in the PFA Team of the Year, and Ciss won the Goal of the Season award for a goal against Chelsea. The 201213 season saw Newcastle regain European football for the first time since 2007. Newcastle made few acquisitions in the summer and suffered injuries over the season, including layoffs to key midfielders Yohan Cabaye and Hatem Ben Arfa, and defenders Steven and Ryan Taylor. As a result, the first half of the season was marred by a run of ten losses in 13 games, which saw the club sink near the relegation zone. In January, Newcastle signed five French players,[58][59][60][61] and advanced to the Europa League quarter-finals before bowing out to eventual finalists Benfica.[62] Domestically, Newcastle struggled, and stayed up after a 21 victory over already-relegated Queens Park Rangers on the penultimate game of the season.[63] The 201415 season saw Newcastle fail to win any of their first seven games, prompting fans to start a campaign to get Pardew sacked as manager[64] before a six-game winning run in all competitions (including knocking holders Manchester City out of the Capital One Cup)[65] saw them climb to fifth in the table. After they ended Chelseas unbeaten start to the season,[66] Pardew left for Crystal Palace.[67] On 26 January 2015, his assistant John Carver was put in charge for the remainder of the season but came close to relegation, staying up on the final day with a 20 home win against West Ham, with Jons Gutirrez, who beat testicular cancer earlier in the season, scoring the teams second goal.[68] On 9 June 2015, Carver and his assistant Steve Stone were both sacked[69] and replaced by Steve McClaren the following day.[70] McClaren subsequently signed Georginio Wijnaldum for 14.5 million from PSV Eindhoven[71] along with both Aleksandar Mitrovi and Chancel Mbemba from Belgian club Anderlecht for 13 million and 8 million, respectively.[72] Newcastle failed to win any of their first eight Premier League games of the 201516 season, a run which included a 01 home defeat against Sheffield Wednesday in the third round of the League Cup.[73] In January 2016, the club signed midfielders Jonjo Shelvey and Andros Townsend for a combined total of 24 million as well as midfielder Henri Saivet.[74][75] However, the club continued to struggle and a 13 defeat to Bournemouth on 5 March left Newcastle with its lowest points total after 28 games in its Premier League history.[76] On 11 March 2016, McClaren was sacked after nine months as manager, with Newcastle in 19th place in the Premier League and the club winning just six of 28 Premier League games during his time at the club.[77] He was replaced by Spaniard Rafael Bentez on the same day, who signed a three-year deal,[77] but was not able to prevent the club from being relegated.[78] However, it was confirmed on 24 April 2017 that Newcastle United will return to Premier League after winning 4-1 to Preston.[79] Newcastle wonthe Championship title on 7 May 2017, after securing a 30 win against Barnsley and Brighton failed to win their game against Aston Villa as they drew 11.[80] The clubs home colours are a black and white striped shirt. Shorts and socks are usually black with white trim, though white socks are sometimes worn under some managers who consider them lucky.[81] Newcastles colours at the outset was generally the home kit of Newcastle East End F.C., comprising plain red shirts with white shorts and red socks. In 1894, the club adopted the black and white striped shirts, which had been used as the reserve teams colours. These colours were chosen for the senior team because they were not associated with either of the two teams United were merged from. They played in grey shorts until 1897, and between 1897 and 1921, they played in blue shorts before adopting the black shorts they play in now.[7][82] Uniteds away colours have changed a number of times over the years. They played in white shirts and black shorts from 1914 until 1961, and then white shorts until 1966. They then played in yellow shirts and blue shorts for the 196768 season, but from 1969 to 1974 played in all red with an all blue third kit. In 1974, they returned to a yellow shirt, which they played with various coloured shorts until 1983. They played in all grey from 1983 to 1988, before once again returning to the yellow kit until 1993. Since 1995, the away kit has changed consistently and has not been the same for more than a single season.[83][84] Through owner Mike Ashley, the club also has a relationship with the Sports Direct retail chain which he founded.[85] On 4 January 2012, Virgin Money, who had just bought Northern Rock, signed a two-year deal to sponsor Newcastle United.[86] In January 2010, Puma became the official supplier and licensee of replica merchandise for Newcastle. The deal meant Puma supplied the team kit, replica kit and training equipment for the 201011 and 201112 seasons.[87] The current club crest was first used in the 198889 season. The crest includes elements from the coat of arms of the city of Newcastle upon Tynethe two sea horses representing Tynesides strong connections with the sea, the castle representing the citys Norman keep.[88] The citys coat of arms were first embroidered on the teams shirts in 1969 and worn as standard until 1976.[82] A scroll at the bottom featured the citys motto in Latin; fortiter defendit triumphans which translates into English as triumphing by brave defence.[89] From 1976 until 1983, the club wore a specific badge which was developed to wear in place of the citys coat of arms. The design was of a circular shape, which featured the clubs name in full, it contained a magpie standing in front of the River Tyne with the historic Norman castle of Newcastle in the background.[90] A more simplistic design followed in 1983, featuring the initials of the clubs name, NUFC with the small magpie used in the previous crest within the horizontally laid C, this logo was relatively short lived and was discontinued after 1988.[90] On 16 May 2013, Newcastle released the away shirt for the 201314 season which for the first time featured the Wonga.com logo, which attracted criticism from many Newcastle supporters; the shirt was navy blue with light blue bands. The shirt received mixed reviews from Newcastle supporters, who described the shirt as both awesome and bland, as quoted in the Newcastle daily Evening Chronicle.[91] In July 2013, Newcastle striker and practicing Muslim Papiss Ciss refused to wear any official kit or training wear with reference to Wonga.com, subsequently failing to travel to the teams 2013 pre-season tour of Portugal.[92] The matter has since been resolved.[93] On 15 May 2017, the home shirt for the 2017-18 season was revealed, featuring the logo of new sponsors Fun88. The shirt was shown to include a gold and silver commemorative crest to mark the clubs 125th football season, based on the citys coat of arms. It was also announced that the kit would feature red numbers for the first time since the 1992-93 season.[94] Previous kit sponsors include Newcastle Breweries (198086), Greenalls Beers (198690), McEwans Lager and Newcastle Brown Ale (19902000), NTL (200003), Northern Rock (200312), and Virgin Money (201213). Newcastles current kit manufacturers are Puma, in a deal that started in 2010. Previous kit manufacturers include Bukta (197475, 197680), Umbro (197576, 198086), Asics (199395) and Adidas (19952010). Other current team sponsors include Fun88, Carling, Coral, Pulman, Thomas Cook Group and Stelrad.[95][96][97] Throughout Newcastle Uniteds history, their home venue has been St James Park, the oldest and largest football stadium in North East England, as well as the sixth-largest football stadium in the United Kingdom.[98] It has hosted ten international football matches at senior level, the first in 1901 and the most recent in 2005.[99][100] It was used as a venue for both the 2012 Summer Olympics and the 2015 Rugby World Cup.[98][101] Football had been played at St James Park as early as 1880, the ground being occupied by Newcastle Rangers, before becoming the home of Newcastle West End F.C. in 1886. Its lease was then bought by Newcastle East End F.C. in 1892, before they changed their name to Newcastle United. At the turn of the 19th century, the grounds capacity was given as 30,000 before being redeveloped between 1900 and 1905, increasing the capacity to 60,000 and making it the biggest stadium in England for a time. For most of the 20th century, the stadium changed very little, despite various plans for development of the ground. The old West Stand was replaced with the Milburn Stand in 1987, the Sir John Hall Stand replacing the Leazes End in 1993, and the rest of the ground renovated making the ground a 37,000 capacity all-seater stadium. Between 1998 and 2000, double tiers were added to the Milburn and John Hall stands to bring the venue up to its current capacity of 52,420. There were plans to build a new 90,000 seater stadium in Leazes park, just behind St James with Newcastle Falcons taking over St James Park, but due to protests the plans were dropped. St James Park currently seats 52,420 people, but club owner Mike Ashley would consider taking the roof off The Gallowgate end and adding another 6,000 seats making the total capacity to 58,420, but only if the team manage to finish in the top six places of the Premier League.[7][102] In October 2009, Mike Ashley announced that he planned to lease the name of the ground in a bid to increase revenue, and in November the stadium was temporarily renamed sportsdirect.com @ St James Park Stadium.[39][103] This name was only supposed to be used until the end of the 200910 season, but lasted until November 2011.[103][104] On 10 November 2011, the club officially changed the name of the stadium to the Sports Direct Arena, although this will most likely be an interim name, as it is only being used to showcase the sponsorship capabilities of the stadium. The company, owned by Ashley, are not paying anything for the deal. However, if another company purchases the naming rights, they will be expected to pay between 8 million and 10 million.[105][106] Many fans voiced their anger at the renaming, but Managing Director Derek Llambias has said that it is necessary to give Newcastle extra money so that they compete with the bigger clubs in the league.[107] Since 1982, the stadium is served by St James Metro station on the Tyne and Wear Metro. The station is decorated in a black and white colour scheme, with archive photographs of the clubs players.[108] The clubs current training ground is located at Darsley Park, which is north of the city at Benton. The facility was opened in July 2003 and is also used by the Newcastle Falcons rugby team.[109] Newcastle United was set up as a private company limited by shares on 6 September 1895.[8] The club traded in this way for much of the 20th century, dominated by McKeag, Westwood and Seymour family ownership,[110] until April 1997, when John Hall, who bought 72.9 of the club for 3million in 1991, floated the club on the stock exchange as a public limited company, with less than half the shares sold to the Hall family and the majority holding going to his business partner Freddy Shepherd. Later that year, Hall stepped down as chairman and was replaced by Shepherd, with the Hall family represented on the board by Johns son Douglas.[111] In December 1998, after buying a 6.3 stake in the club for 10 million, the media group NTL had considered a full takeover of the club. This was later dropped after the April 1999 Competition Commission, brought in due to government concerns about football clubs being owned by media companies.[112] In 2007, businessman Mike Ashley purchased the combined stakes of both Douglas and John Hall, 41 share in the club, through a holding company St James Holdings, with a view to buy the rest.[113] Upon purchasing this share, he appointed Chris Mort as chairman, while gaining more shares, owning 93.19 of the club by 29 June 2007.[114] This figure reached 95 on 11 July 2007, forcing the remaining shareholders to sell their shares.[115] Since completing the purchase of the club, Ashley has twice announced that he planned to sell the club. The first occurred after fan protests over the resignation of Kevin Keegan on 14 September 2008, when Ashley stated, I have listened to you. You want me out. That is what I am now trying to do.[116] However, he took it off the market on 28 December 2008 after being unable to find a buyer.[117] On 31 May 2009, it was reported that Ashley was attempting to sell the club again.[118][119] On 8 June 2009, Ashley confirmed that the club was up for sale at an asking price of 100million.[120] By the end of August 2009, the club was back off the market.[121] Newcastle United established the Newcastle United Foundation in summer 2008, which seeks to encourage learning and promote healthy living amongst disadvantaged children, young people and families in the North East region, as well as promoting equality and diversity.[122][123] The Foundations manager Kate Bradley told charity news website The Third Sector, Children look up to players as their heroes, and anything they say is instantly taken on board. If Newcastle defender Steven Taylor tells them not to eat a Mars bar for breakfast, theyll listen.[124] In 2010, the charity taught over 5,000 children about healthy living.[122] The Foundations commitment, along with a similar foundation run by West Bromwich Albion, the unique relationship that Aston Villa has with Acorns Childrens Hospice and Tottenham Hotspur has with SOS Childrens Villages UK, are some leading examples of commitment in the highest level of football to responsibility and change in the communities in which they work and who enrich them through their support and ticket sales. The work of these clubs, and others, are changing the way professional sport interacts with their communities and supporters.[125][126] In December 2012, the club announced that it had become the worlds first carbon positive football club.[127] Supporters of Newcastle United are drawn from all over the North East and beyond, with supporters clubs in some countries across the world.[128] The clubs nickname is The Magpies, while the clubs supporters are also known as the Geordies or the Toon Army. The name Toon originates from the Geordie pronunciation of town.[129][130] In a 2004 survey by Co-operative Financial Services, it was found that Newcastle United topped the league table for the cost incurred and distance travelled by Newcastle-based fans wishing to travel to every Premier League away game. The total distance travelled for a fan to attend every away game from Newcastle was found to be equivalent to a round-the-world trip.[131] In the 200910 season, when the club were playing in English footballs second tier, the Football League Championship, the average attendance at St James Park was 43,388, the fourth-highest for an English club that season.[132] At the end of the 201112 Premier league season, Newcastle United held the third-highest average attendance for the season, at 49,935.[133] This figure was only surpassed by Arsenal and Manchester United, the only two clubs in the Premier League with larger stadiums. The clubs supporters publish a number of fanzines including True Faith and The Mag, along with NUFC.com, which was established in 1996. They set up Newcastle United Supporters Trust in September 2008, aiming to represent the broad church of Newcastle Uniteds support.[134] In addition to the usual English football chants, Newcastles supporters sing the traditional Tyneside song Blaydon Races.[135][136] Traditionally, Newcastles main rivals are Sunderland, against whom the TyneWear derby is competed.[137] Many Newcastle fans also consider Middlesbrough to be a secondary rival, with whom they contest the TyneTees derby To date, inclusive of the 201516 season, Newcastle United have spent 85 seasons in the top-flight. They are eighth in the All-time FA Premier League table and have the ninth-highest total of major honours won by an English club with 11 wins.[138] The holder of the record for the most appearances is Jimmy Lawrence, having made 496 first team appearances between 1904 and 1921.[139] The clubs top goal scorer is Alan Shearer, who scored 206 goals in all competitions between 1996 and 2006.[140] Andy Cole holds the record for the most goals scored in a season: 41 in the 199394 season in the Premier League.[139] Shay Given is the most capped international for the club, with 134 appearances for Republic of Ireland.[139] The clubs widest victory margin in the league was in the 130 win against Newport County in the Second Division in 1946. Their heaviest defeat in the league was 90 against Burton Wanderers in the Second Division in 1895.[139] The clubs longest number of consecutive seasons in the top flight of English football was 36 from 189899 until 193334. Newcastles record home attendance is 68,386 for a First Division match against Chelsea on 3 September 1930.[139] The clubs highest attendance in the Premier League is 52,389, in a match against Manchester City on 6 May 2012. Newcastle lost the game 20.[141] The highest transfer fee received for a Newcastle player is 35million, from Liverpool for Andy Carroll in January 2011, while the most spent by the club on a player was 16million for striker Michael Owen from Real Madrid in August 2005.[46][139] [142] [142] [142] The current Newcastle United first team squad consist of the following players: Note: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules.

Villa, The Villa, The Villans, The Lions)[3] is a professional football club in Aston, Birmingham, that plays in the Championship, the second level of English football. Founded in 1874, they have played at their current home ground, Villa Park, since 1897. Aston Villa were one of the founder members of the Football League in 1888 and of the Premier League in 1992.[4] Aston Villa are one of only five English clubs to be crowned champions of Europe, having won the 198182 European Cup. They have also won the First Division Championship seven times, the FA Cup seven times, the Football League Cup five times, and the UEFA Super Cup once. They have a fierce local rivalry with Birmingham City and the Second City derby between the sides has been played since 1879.[5] The clubs traditional kit colours are claret shirts with sky blue sleeves, white shorts and sky blue socks. Their traditional badge is of a rampant lion.[6][7] The club is currently owned by Recon Group Limited, a company chaired by Chinese businessman Tony Xia, and managed by Steve Bruce.   Aston Villa Football Club were formed in March 1874, by members of the Villa Cross Wesleyan Chapel in Handsworth which is now part of Birmingham. The four founders of Aston Villa were Jack Hughes, Frederick Matthews, Walter Price and William Scattergood.[8] Aston Villas first match was against the local Aston Brook St Marys Rugby team. As a condition of the match, the Villa side had to agree to play the first half under Rugby rules and the second half under Association rules.[9] After moving to the Wellington Road ground in 1876, Villa soon established themselves as one of the best teams in the Midlands, winning their first honour, the Birmingham Senior Cup in 1880, under the captaincy of Scotsman George Ramsay.[10] The club won their first FA Cup in 1887 with captain Archie Hunter becoming one of the games first household names. Aston Villa were one of the dozen teams that competed in the inaugural Football League in 1888 with one of the clubs directors, William McGregor being the leagues founder. Aston Villa emerged as the most successful English club of the Victorian era, winning no fewer than five League titles and three FA Cups by the end of Queen Victorias reign.[11] In 1897, the year Villa won The Double, they moved into their present home, the Aston Lower Grounds.[12] Supporters coined the name Villa Park; no official declaration listed the ground as Villa Park.[13] Aston Villa won their sixth FA Cup in 1920, soon after though the club began a slow decline that led to Villa, at the time one of the most famous and successful clubs in world football, being relegated in 1936 for the first time to the Second Division. This was largely the result of a dismal defensive record: they conceded 110 goals in 42 games, 7 of them coming from Arsenals Ted Drake in an infamous 17 defeat at Villa Park.[14] Like all English clubs, Villa lost seven seasons to the Second World War, and that conflict brought several careers to a premature end.[15] The team was rebuilt under the guidance of former player Alex Massie for the remainder of the 1940s. Aston Villas first trophy for 37 years came in the 195657 season when another former Villa player, Eric Houghton led the club to a then record seventh FA Cup Final win, defeating the Busby Babes of Manchester United in the final.[16] The team struggled in the league though and were relegated two seasons later, due in large part to complacency. However, under the stewardship of manager Joe Mercer Villa returned to the top-flight in 1960 as Second Division Champions. The following season Aston Villa became the first team to win the Football League Cup.[17] Mercers forced retirement from the club in 1964 signalled a period of deep turmoil. The most successful club in England was struggling to keep pace with changes in the modern game, with Villa being relegated for the third time, under manager Dick Taylor in 1967. The following season the fans called for the board to resign as Villa finished 16th in the Second Division. With mounting debts and Villa lying at the bottom of Division Two, the board sacked Tommy Cummings (the manager brought in to replace Taylor), and within weeks the entire board resigned under overwhelming pressure from fans.[18] After much speculation, control of the club was bought by London financier Pat Matthews, who also brought in Doug Ellis as chairman.[18] However, new ownership could not prevent Villa being relegated to the Third Division for the first time at the end of the 196970 season. However, Villa gradually began to recover under the management of former club captain Vic Crowe. In the 197172 season they returned to the Second Division as Champions with a record 70 points.[19] In 1974, Ron Saunders was appointed manager. His brand of no-nonsense man-management proved effective, with the club winning the League Cup the following season and, at the end of season 197475, he had taken them back into the First Division and into Europe.[20] Villa were back among the elite as Saunders continued to mould a winning team. This culminated in a seventh top-flight league title in 198081. To the surprise of commentators and fans, Saunders quit halfway through the 198182 season, after falling out with the chairman, with Villa in the quarter final of the European Cup. He was replaced by his softly-spoken assistant manager Tony Barton who guided the club to a 10 victory over Bayern Munich in the European Cup final in Rotterdam courtesy of a Peter Withe goal. The following season Villa were crowned European Super Cup winners, beating Barcelona in the final. This marked a pinnacle though and Villas fortunes declined sharply for most of the 1980s, culminating in relegation in 1987.[21] This was followed by promotion the following year under Graham Taylor and a runners-up position in the First Division in the 198990 season.[22] Villa were one of the founding members of the Premier League in 1992, and finished runners-up to Manchester United in the inaugural season. For the rest of the Nineties however Villa went through three different managers and their league positions were inconsistent, although they did win two League Cups and regularly achieved UEFA Cup qualification. Villa reached the FA Cup final in 2000 but lost 10 to Chelsea in the last game to be played at the old Wembley Stadium.[23][24] Again Villas league position continued to fluctuate under several different managers and things came to a head in the summer of 2006 when David OLeary left in acrimony.[25] After 23 years as chairman and single biggest shareholder (approximately 38), Doug Ellis finally decided to sell his stake in Aston Villa due to ill-health. After much speculation it was announced the club was to be bought by American businessman Randy Lerner, owner of NFL franchise the Cleveland Browns.[26] The arrival of a new owner in Lerner and of manager Martin ONeill marked the start of a new period of optimism at Villa Park and sweeping changes occurred throughout the club including a new badge, a new kit sponsor and team changes in the summer of 2007.[27][28] The first Cup final of the Lerner era came in 2010 when Villa were beaten 21 in the League Cup Final.[29] Villa made a second trip to Wembley in that season losing 30 to Chelsea in the FA Cup semifinal. Just five days before the opening day of the 201011 season, ONeill resigned as manager,[30] and after one year with Grard Houllier in charge, Birmingham City manager Alex McLeish, despite numerous protests from fans against his appointment; this was the first time that a manager had moved directly between the two rivals.[31] McLeishs contract was terminated at the end of the 201112 season after Villa finished in 16th place,[32] and he was replaced by Paul Lambert.[33] In February 2012, the club announced a financial loss of 53.9million,[34] and Lerner put the club up for sale three months later, with an estimated value of 200 million.[35] With Lerner still on board, in the 201415 season Aston Villa scored just 12 goals in 25 league games, the lowest in Premier League history, and Lambert was sacked in February 2015.[36] Tim Sherwood succeeded him,[37] and steered the club away from relegation while also leading them to the 2015 FA Cup Final, but he was sacked in the 201516 season,[38] as was his successor Rmi Garde, in a campaign ended with Villa relegated for the first time since 1987.[39] In June 2016, Chinese businessman Tony Xia bought the club for 76 million.[40] Roberto Di Matteo was appointed as the clubs new manager before the new season, and was sacked after 12 games,[41] to be replaced by former Birmingham manager Steve Bruce.[42] The club colours are a claret shirt with sky blue sleeves, white shorts with claret and blue trim, and sky blue socks with claret and white trim. They were the original wearers of the claret and blue. Villas colours at the outset generally comprised plain shirts (white, grey or a shade of blue), with either white or black shorts. For a few years after that (187779) the team wore several different kits from all white, blue and black, red and blue to plain green. By 1880, black jerseys with a red lion embroidered on the chest were introduced by William McGregor. This remained the first choice strip for six years. On Monday, 8 November 1886, an entry in the clubs official minute book states: (i) Proposed and seconded that the colours be chocolate and sky blue shirts and that we order two dozen. (ii) Proposed and seconded that Mr McGregor be requested to supply them at the lowest quotation. The chocolate colour later became claret.[43] Nobody is quite sure why claret and blue became the clubs adopted colours.[43] Several other English football teams adopted their colours; clubs that wear claret and blue include West Ham United and Burnley.[44][45] A new badge was revealed in May 2007, for the 200708 season and beyond. The new badge includes a star to represent the European Cup win in 1982, and has a light blue background behind Villas lion rampant. The traditional motto Prepared remains in the badge, and the name Aston Villa has been shortened to AVFC, FC having been omitted from the previous badge. The lion is now unified as opposed to fragmented lions of the past. Randy Lerner petitioned fans to help with the design of the new badge.[27] On 6 April 2016, the club confirmed that it will be using a new badge from the 201617 season after consulting fan groups for suggestions. The lion in the new badge will have claws added to it and the word Prepared will be removed to increase the size of the lion and club initials in the badge.[7] Aston Villa forwent commercial kit sponsorship for the 200809 and 200910 seasons; instead advertising the charity Acorns Childrens Hospice, the first deal of its kind in Premier league history.[46] The partnership continued until 2010 when a commercial sponsor replaced Acorns, with the hospice becoming the clubs Official Charity Partner.[47] In 201415, the Acorns name returned to Aston Villas home and away shirts, but only for childrens shirts re-affirming the clubs support for the childrens charity. Since 2015 Villas shirt sponsors have been Quickbooks. Previous commercial sponsors have been Davenports (198283), Mita (198393), Mller (199395), AST Computer (199598), LDV (19982000), NTL (200002), Rover (200204), DWS Investments(200406), 32Red.com (200608), FxPro (201011), Genting Casinos (201113), Dafabet (20132015), and Intuit QuickBooks (2015). Since 2016, kit has been manufactured by Under Armour. Previous manufacturers have been Umbro (197281, 199093), le Coq Sportif (198183), Henson (198387), Hummel (198790, 200407), Asics (199395), Reebok (19952000), Diadora (200004), Nike (200712) and Macron (201216). Aston Villas current home venue is Villa Park, which is a UEFA 5-star rated stadium, having previously played at Aston Park (18741876) and Wellington Road (18761897). Villa Park is the largest football stadium in the English Midlands, and the eighth largest stadium in England. It has hosted 16 England internationals at senior level, the first in 1899, and the most recent in 2005. Thus, it was the first English ground to stage international football in three different centuries.[48] Villa Park is the most used stadium in FA Cup semi-final history, having hosted 55 semi-finals. The club have planning permission to extend the North Stand; this will involve the filling in of the corners to either side of the North Stand. If completed, the capacity of Villa Park will be increased to approximately 51,000. The current training ground is located at Bodymoor Heath near Kingsbury in north Warwickshire, the site for which was purchased by former chairman Doug Ellis in the early 1970s from a local farmer. Although Bodymoor Heath was state-of-the-art in the 1970s, by the late 1990s the facilities had started to look dated. In November 2005, Ellis and Aston Villa plc announced a state of the art GB13million redevelopment of Bodymoor in two phases. However, work on Bodymoor was suspended by Ellis due to financial problems, and was left in an unfinished state until new owner Randy Lerner made it one of his priorities to make the site one of the best in world football. The new training ground was officially unveiled on 6 May 2007, by then manager Martin ONeill, then team captain Gareth Barry and 1982 European Cup winning team captain Dennis Mortimer, with the Aston Villa squad moving in for the 200708 season.[49] It was announced on 6 August 2014, that Villa Park would appear in the FIFA video game from FIFA 15 onwards, with all other Premier League stadiums also fully licensed from this game onwards.[50] The first shares in the club were issued towards the end of the 19th century as a result of legislation that was intended to codify the growing numbers of professional teams and players in the Association Football leagues. FA teams were required to distribute shares to investors as a way of facilitating trading among the teams without implicating the FA itself. This trading continued for much of the 20th century until Ellis started buying up many of the shares in the 1960s. He was chairman and substantial shareholder of Aston Villa F.C. from 1968 to 1975 and the majority shareholder from 1982 to 2006. The club were floated on the London Stock Exchange (LSE) in 1996, and the share price fluctuated in the ten years after the flotation.[51] In 2006 it was announced that several consortia and individuals were considering bids for Aston Villa.[52] On 14 August 2006, it was confirmed that Randy Lerner, then owner of the National Football Leagues Cleveland Browns, had reached an agreement of 62.6million with Aston Villa for a takeover of the club. A statement released on 25 August to the LSE announced that Lerner had secured 59.69 of Villa shares, making him the majority shareholder. He also appointed himself Chairman of the club.[53] In Elliss last year in charge Villa lost 8.2m before tax, compared with a 3m profit the previous year, and income had fallen from 51.6m to 49m.[52] Lerner took full control on 18 September, as he had 89.69 of the shares. On 19 September 2006, Ellis and his board resigned to be replaced with a new board headed by Lerner.[52] Lerner installed Charles Krulak as a non-executive director and Ellis was awarded the honorary position of Chairman Emeritus. Lerner put the club up for sale in May 2014, valuing it at an estimated 200million.[54] On 18 May 2016, Randy Lerner agreed the sale of Aston Villa to Recon Group, owned by Chinese businessman Xia Jiantong. The sale was completed on 14 June 2016 for a reported 76 million after being approved by the Football League, with the club becoming part of Recon Groups Sport, Leisure and Tourism division.[55][56][57] Recon Group were selected to take over Aston Villa following a selection process by the club.[58][59] Aston Villa have a unique relationship with the Acorns Childrens Hospice charity that is groundbreaking in English football.[60] In a first for the Premier League, Aston Villa donated the front of the shirt on their kit, usually reserved for high-paying sponsorships, to Acorns Hospice so that the charity would gain significant additional visibility and greater fund raising capabilities.[61] Outside of the shirt sponsorship the club have paid for hospice care for the charity as well as regularly providing player visits to hospice locations.[62][63] In September 2010, Aston Villa launched an initiative at Villa Park called Villa Midlands Food (VMF) where the club will spend two years training students with Aston Villa Hospitality and Events in association with Birmingham City Council. The club will open a restaurant in the Trinity Road Stand staffed with 12 students recruited from within a ten-mile (16km) radius of Villa Park with the majority of the food served in the restaurant sourced locally.[64] Aston Villa have a large fanbase and draw support from all over the Midlands and beyond, with supporters clubs all across the world. Former Villa chief executive Richard Fitzgerald has stated that the ethnicity of the supporters is currently 98 white. When Randy Lerners regime took over at Villa Park, they aimed to improve their support from ethnic minorities. A number of organisations have been set up to support the local community including Aston Pride.[65] A Villa in the Community programme has also been set up to encourage support among young people in the region.[66] The new owners have also initiated several surveys aimed at gaining the opinions of Villa fans and to involve them in the decision making process. Meetings also occur every three months where supporters are invited by ballot and are invited to ask questions to the Board.[67] In 2011, the club supported a supporter-based initiative for an official anthem to boost the atmosphere at Villa Park. The song The Bells Are Ringing is to be played before games.[68] Like many English football clubs Aston Villa have had several hooligan firms associated with them: Villa Youth, Steamers, Villa Hardcore and the C-Crew, the last mentioned being very active during the 1970s and 1980s. As can be seen across the whole of English football, the hooligan groups have now been marginalised.[69] In 2004, several Villa firms were involved in a fight with QPR fans outside Villa Park in which a steward died.[70] The main groupings of supporters can now be found in a number of domestic and international supporters clubs. This includes the Official Aston Villa Supporters Club which also has many smaller regional and international sections.[71] There were several independent supporters clubs during the reign of Doug Ellis but most of these disbanded after his retirement.[53] The supporter group My Old Man Said formed to stand up for Villa supporters rights, as a direct result of Villa supporters protest against the clubs appointment of Alex McLeish. The clubs supporters also publish fanzines such as Heroes and Villains and The Holy Trinity. Aston Villas arch-rivals are Birmingham City, with games between the two clubs known as the Second City Derby.[5] Historically though, West Bromwich Albion have arguably been Villas greatest rivals, a view highlighted in a fan survey, conducted in 2003.[72] The two teams contested three FA Cup finals in the late 19th century. Villa also enjoy less heated local rivalries with Wolverhampton Wanderers and Coventry City. Through the relegation of West Brom and Birmingham City, to the Football League Championship, in the 200506 season, at the start of 200607 Premiership season, Villa were the only Midlands club in that League. The nearest opposing team Villa faced during that season was Sheffield United, who played 62 miles (100km) away in South Yorkshire.[73] For the 201011 season, West Bromwich Albion were promoted and joined Aston Villa, Wolverhampton Wanderers, and Birmingham City in the Premier League. This marked the first time that the West Midlands Big Four clubs have been in the Premier League at the same time, and the first time together in the top flight since the 198384 season. Birmingham were relegated at the end of the 201011 season, ending this period.[74] At the end of the 201516 season Aston Villa had spent 105 seasons in the top tier of English football; the only club to have spent longer in the top flight are Everton, with 114 seasons,[75] making Aston Villa versus Everton the most-played fixture in English top-flight football. Aston Villa were relegated in from the top tier of English football in 2016, having played in every Premier League season since its establishment in 199293. They are seventh in the All-time FA Premier League table, and have the fifth highest total of major honours won by an English club with 21 wins.[76] Aston Villa currently hold the record number of league goals scored by any team in the English top flight; 128 goals were scored in the 193031 season, one more than Arsenal who won the league that season for the very first time, with Villa runners-up.[77] Villa legend Archie Hunter became the first player to score in every round of the FA Cup in Villas victorious 1887 campaign. Villas longest unbeaten home run in the FA Cup spanned 13 years and 19 games, from 1888 to 1901.[78] Aston Villa are one of five English teams to have won the European Cup. They did so on 26 May 1982 in Rotterdam, beating Bayern Munich 10 thanks to Peter Withes goal.[79] Aston Villa have won European and domestic league honours. The clubs last major honour was in 1996 when they won the League Cup. Note: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules. Players may hold more than one non-FIFA nationality. Note: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules. Players may hold more than one non-FIFA nationality. There have been many players who can be called notable throughout Aston Villas history. These can be classified and recorded in several forms. The Halls of Fame and PFA Players of the Year are noted below. As of 2014[update], Aston Villa, jointly with Tottenham Hotspur, hold the record for providing the most England internationals with 73.[82] Aston Villa have had several players who were one-club men, including inaugural club Hall of Fame inductee Billy Walker. In 1998, to celebrate the 100th season of League football, The Football League released a list entitled the Football League 100 Legends that consisted of 100 legendary football players. There were seven players included on the list who had formerly played for Villa: Danny Blanchflower, Trevor Ford, Archie Hunter, Sam Hardy, Paul McGrath, Peter Schmeichel and Clem Stephenson.[83] Three Aston Villa players have won the PFA Players Player of the Year award. In 1977 Andy Gray won the award. In 1990 it was awarded to David Platt, whilst Paul McGrath won it in 1993. The PFA Young Player of the Year, which is awarded to players under the age of 23, has been awarded to four players from Aston Villa: Andy Gray in 1977; Gary Shaw in 1981; Ashley Young in 2009 and James Milner in 2010. The National Football Museum in Preston, Lancashire administers the English Football Hall of Fame which currently contains two Villa teams, two Villa players and one manager. The 1890s team and 1982 team were inducted into the Hall of Fame in July 2009. Joe Mercer was inducted into the Hall of Fame at the same time for his career as a manager including his time at Aston Villa.[84] The only two Villa players in the Hall of Fame are Danny Blanchflower and Peter Schmeichel. In 2006 the club announced the creation of an Aston Villa Hall of Fame. This was voted for by fans and the inaugural induction saw 12 former players, managers and directors named.[10] Stiliyan Petrov was added to the list in May 2013.[85] The following managers have all won at least one trophy when in charge or have been notable for Villa in the context of the League, for example Jozef Venglo who holds a League record. A number of television programmes have included references to Aston Villa over the past few decades. In the sitcom Porridge, the character Lennie Godber is a Villa supporter.[88] When filming began on Dads Army, Villa fan Ian Lavender was allowed to choose Frank Pikes scarf from an array in the BBC wardrobe; he chose a claret and blue oneAston Villas colours.[89] The character Nessa in the BBC sitcom Gavin & Stacey was revealed as an Aston Villa fan in an episode screened in December 2009.[90] In the 1952 film The Card, the main character Denry Machin becomes a town councillor and purchases the rights to locally born Aston Villa player Callear, the greatest centre-forward in England, for the failing local football club. Villa have also featured on several occasions in prose. Stanley Woolley, a character in Derek Robinsons Booker shortlisted novel Goshawk Squadron is an Aston Villa fan and names a pre-war starting eleven Villa side. Together with The Oval, Villa Park is referenced by the poet Philip Larkin in his poem about the First World War, MCMXIV.[91] Aston Villa are also mentioned in Harold Pinters play The Dumb Waiter.[92]

Football Club S.p.A. (from Latin iuvents, youth; Italian pronunciation:[juvntus]), colloquially known as Juve (pronounced[juve]),[4] is a professional Italian football club in Turin, Piedmont. Founded in 1897 by some Torinese students, the club has worn a black and white striped home kit since 1903 and had played home matches in different grounds around its city, being the latest the 41,507-capacity Juventus Stadium. Nicknamed Vecchia Signora (the Old Lady), the club is the most successful in Italian football and leads the historical Federazione Italiana Giuoco Calcio (FIGC) ranking,[5] having won also more trophies overall than any other club in the country: sixty-three, including a record thirty-three official league titles, a record twelve Coppa Italia titles, a record seven national supercups titles, two Intercontinental Cups, two European Champion Clubs Cup and UEFA Champions Leagues, one European Cup Winners Cup, three UEFA Cups, two UEFA Super Cups and one UEFA Intertoto Cup, making it also one of the most decorated clubs at international level.[6][7] Founded with the name of Sport-Club Juventus, initially as a athletics club,[8] it is the second oldest of its kind still active in the country after Genoas football section (1893) and has competed uninterruptedly in the top flight league (reformulated as Serie A from 1929) since its debut in 1900, with the exception of the 200607 season, being managed by the industrial Agnelli family almost continuously since 1923.[9] The relationship between the club and that dynasty is the oldest and longest in national sports, making Juventus the first professional sporting club in the country,[10] having established itself as a major force in the national stage since the 1930s and at confederation level since the mid-1970s[11] and becoming one of the first ten wealthiest in world football in terms of value, revenue and profit since mid-1990s,[12] being stocked in Borsa italiana since 2001.[13] Under the management of Giovanni Trapattoni, Juventus won thirteen trophies in the ten years before 1986, including six league titles and five international titles, and became the first club to win all three competitions organised by the Union of European Football Associations: the European Champions Cup, Cup Winners Cup and UEFA Cup.[14] With successive triumphs in the 1984 European Super Cup and 1985 Intercontinental Cup, it become the first and thus far only in the world to complete a clean sweep of all confederation trophies;[15] an achievement that they revalidated with the title won in the 1999 UEFA Intertoto Cup after another successful era led by Marcello Lippi.[16] In December 2000, Juventus was ranked seventh in the FIFAs historic ranking of the best clubs in the world[17] and nine years later was ranked second best club in Europe during the 20th Century based on a statistical study series by the International Federation of Football History & Statistics (IFFHS), the highest for an Italian club in both.[18] The clubs fan base is the largest at national level and one of the largest worldwide.[19][20] Unlike most European sporting supporters groupsoften concentrated around their own clubs city of origin[21], it is widespread throughout the Apennine Peninsula and Italian diaspora, making Juventus a symbol of anticampanilismo (Anti-parochialism) and italianit (Italianness).[22][23] Club to have provided more players to the national team, different Juventus players groups in the Azzurri squad led that side to international success, mostly in 1934, 1982 and 2006 FIFA World Cups.[24][25]   Juventus were founded as Sport-Club Juventus in late 1897 by pupils from the Massimo DAzeglio lyceum school in Turin,[26] but were renamed as Foot-Ball Club Juventus two years later.[2] The club joined the Italian Football Championship during 1900. In 1904, the businessman Ajmone-Marsan revived the finances of the football club Juventus, making it also possible to transfer the training field from piazza darmi to the more appropriate Velodrome Umberto I. During this period, the team wore a pink and black kit. Juventus first won the league championship in 1905 while playing at their Velodrome Umberto I ground. By this time the club colours had changed to black and white stripes, inspired by English side Notts County.[27] There was a split at the club in 1906, after some of the staff considered moving Juve out of Turin.[2] President Alfred Dick[28] was unhappy with this and left with some prominent players to found FBC Torino which in turn spawned the Derby della Mole.[29] Juventus spent much of this period steadily rebuilding after the split, surviving the First World War.[27] FIAT owner Edoardo Agnelli gained control of the club in 1923 and built a new stadium.[2] This helped the club to its second scudetto (league championship) in the 192526 season, after beating Alba Roma with an aggregate score of 121 (Antonio Vojaks goals were essential that season).[27] The club established itself as a major force in Italian football since the 1930s, becoming the countrys first professional club and the first with a decentralised fan base,[30] which led it to win a record of five consecutive Italian championships (the first four under the management of Carlo Carcano) and form the core of the Italy national team during the Vittorio Pozzos era, including the 1934 world champion squad,[31] with star players such as Raimundo Orsi, Luigi Bertolini, Giovanni Ferrari and Luis Monti amongst others. Juventus moved to the Stadio Comunale, but for the rest of the 1930s and the majority of the 1940s they were unable to recapture championship dominance. After the Second World War, Gianni Agnelli was appointed honorary president.[2] The club added two more league championships to its name in the 194950 and 195152 seasons, the latter of which was under the management of Englishman Jesse Carver. Two new strikers were signed during 195758: Welshman John Charles and Italian Argentine Omar Svori, playing alongside longtime member Giampiero Boniperti. That season saw Juventus awarded with the Golden Star for Sport Excellence to wear on their shirts after becoming the first Italian side to win ten league titles. In the same season, Svori became the first ever player at the club to win the European Footballer of the Year.[32] The following season, they beat Fiorentina to complete their first league and cup double, winning Serie A and Coppa Italia. Boniperti retired in 1961 as the all-time top scorer at the club, with 182goals in all competitions, a club record which stood for 45 years.[33] During the rest of the decade, the club won the league just once more in 196667.[27] However, the 1970s saw Juventus further solidify their strong position in Italian football. Under former player estmr Vycplek, they won the scudetto in 197172 and 197273,[27] with players such as Roberto Bettega, Franco Causio and Jos Altafini breaking through. During the rest of the decade, they won the league twice more, with defender Gaetano Scirea contributing significantly. The later win was under Giovanni Trapattoni, who also led the club to their first ever major European title (the UEFA Cup) in 1977 and helped the clubs domination continue on into the early part of the 1980s.[34] During Trapattonis tenure, many Juventus players also formed the backbone of the Italy national team during Enzo Bearzots successful managerial era, including the 1978 World Cup, UEFA Euro 1980 and 1982 world champion squads.[35][36]  I played for Nancy because it was my hometown club and the best in Lorraine, for Saint-tienne because it was the best team in France and for Juventus because it is the best team in the world![37] The Trapattoni era was highly successful in the 1980s and the club started the decade off well, winning the league title three more times by 1984.[27] This meant Juventus had won 20 Italian league titles and were allowed to add a second golden star to their shirt, thus becoming the only Italian club to achieve this.[34] Around this time, the clubs players were attracting considerable attention and Paolo Rossi was named European Footballer of the Year following his contribution to Italys victory in the 1982 World Cup, where he was named Player of the Tournament.[38] Frenchman Michel Platini was also awarded the European Footballer of the Year title for three years in a row in 1983, 1984 and 1985, which is a record.[32] Juventus are the only club to have players from their club winning the award in four consecutive years.[32] It was Platini who scored the winning goal in the 1985 European Cup final against Liverpool, but this was marred by a tragedy which changed European football.[39] That year, Juventus became the first club in the history of European football to have won all three major UEFA competitions[14][40] and, after their triumph in the Intercontinental Cup, the club also became the first in association football historyand remain the worlds only one at presentto have won all possible confederation competitions and the club world title.[41] With the exception of winning the closely contested Italian Championship of 198586, the rest of the 1980s were not very successful for the club. As well as having to contend with Diego Maradonas Napoli, both of the Milanese clubs, Milan and Internazionale, won Italian championships. However, Juventus did win a Coppa Italia-UEFA Cup double in 1990 under the guidance of former club legend Dino Zoff.[27] In 1990, Juventus also moved into their new home, the Stadio delle Alpi, which was built for the 1990 World Cup.[42] Despite the arrival of Italian star Roberto Baggio later that year for a world record transfer fee, the early 1990s under Luigi Maifredi and subsequently Trapattoni once again also saw little success for Juventus, as they only managed to win the UEFA Cup in 1993.[43]  Marcello Lippi took over as Juventus manager at the start of the 199495 campaign.[2] His first season at the helm of the club was a successful one, as Juventus recorded their first Serie A championship title since the mid-1980s, as well as the Coppa Italia.[27] The crop of players during this period featured Ciro Ferrara, Roberto Baggio, Gianluca Vialli and a young Alessandro Del Piero. Lippi led Juventus to their first Supercoppa Italiana and the Champions League the following season, beating Ajax on penalties after a 11 draw in which Fabrizio Ravanelli scored for Juventus.[44] The club did not rest long after winning the European Cup: more highly regarded players were brought into the fold in the form of Zinedine Zidane, Filippo Inzaghi and Edgar Davids. At home, Juventus won the 199697 and 199798 Serie A titles, as well as the 1996 UEFA Super Cup[45] and the 1996 Intercontinental Cup.[46] Juventus reached the 1997 and 1998 Champions League finals during this period, but lost out to Borussia Dortmund and Real Madrid respectively.[47][48] After a two-and-a-half-season absence, Lippi returned to the club in 2001, following his replacement Carlo Ancelottis dismissal, signing big name players such as Gianluigi Buffon, David Trezeguet, Pavel Nedvd and Lilian Thuram, helping the team to two more scudetto titles during the 200102 and 200203 seasons.[27] Juventus were also part of an all Italian Champions League final in 2003, but lost out to Milan on penalties after the game ended in a 00 draw. At the conclusion of the following season, Lippi was appointed as the Italy national teams head coach, bringing an end to one of the most fruitful managerial spells in Juventus history.[34] Fabio Capello was appointed as Juventus coach in 2004 and led the club to two more consecutive Serie A titles. In May 2006, Juventus became one of the five clubs linked to a 2006 Italian football scandal, the result of which saw the club relegated to Serie B for the first time in its history. The club was also stripped of the two titles won under Capello in 2005 and 2006.[49] Many key players left following the demotion to Serie B, including Lillian Thuram, star striker Zlatan Ibrahimovi and defensive stalwart Fabio Cannavaro. However, other big name players such as Alessandro Del Piero, Gianluigi Buffon, David Trezeguet and Pavel Nedvd remained to help the club return to Serie A, while youngsters from the Primavera (youth team), such as Sebastian Giovinco and Claudio Marchisio, were integrated into the first team. Juventus won the Cadetti (Serie B championship) and gained promotion straight back up to the top division as league winners after the 200607 season,[50] as captain Del Piero claimed the top scorer award with 21 goals. As early as 2010, Juventus considered challenging the stripping of their scudetti from 2005 and 2006, dependent on the results of trials connected to the 2006 scandal.[51] Subsequent investigations found in 2011 that Juventus relegation in 2006 was without merit.[52] When former general manager Luciano Moggis conviction in criminal court in connection with the scandal was thrown out by an appeals court in 2015, the club sued the Italian Football Federation (FIGC) for 443million for damages caused by their 2006 relegation. FIGC president Carlo Tavecchio offered to discuss reinstatement of the lost scudetti in exchange for Juventus dropping the lawsuit.[52] After returning to Serie A in the 200708 season, Juventus appointed Claudio Ranieri as manager.[53] They finished in third place in their first season back in the top flight and qualified for the Champions League third qualifying round in the preliminary stages. Juventus reached the group stages, where they beat Real Madrid in both home and away legs, before losing in the knockout round to Chelsea. Ranieri was sacked following a string of unsuccessful results and Ciro Ferrara was appointed as manager on a temporary basis for the last two games of the 200809 season,[54] before being subsequently appointed as the manager for the 200910 season.[55] Ferraras stint as Juventus manager, however, proved to be unsuccessful, with Juventus knocked out of Champions League and Coppa Italia, as well as just lying on the sixth place in the league table at the end of January 2010, leading to the dismissal of Ferrara and the naming of Alberto Zaccheroni as caretaker manager. Zaccheroni could not help the side improve, as Juventus finished the season in seventh place in Serie A. For the 201011 season, Jean-Claude Blanc was replaced by Andrea Agnelli as the clubs president. Agnellis first action was to replace Zaccheroni and director of sport Alessio Secco with Sampdoria manager Luigi Delneri and director of sport Giuseppe Marotta.[56] However, Delneri failed to improve their fortunes and was dismissed. Former player and fan favourite Antonio Conte, fresh after winning promotion with Siena, was named as Delneris replacement.[57] In September 2011, Juventus relocated to the new Juventus Stadium.[58] Winning is not important, it is the only thing that counts! With Conte as manager, Juventus went unbeaten for the entire 201112 Serie A season. Towards the second half of the season, the team was mostly competing with northern rivals Milan for first place in a tight contest. Juventus won the title on the 37th matchday after beating Cagliari 20 and Milan losing to Internazionale 42. After a 31 win in the final matchday against Atalanta, Juventus became the first team to go the season unbeaten in the current 38-game format.[60] Other noteworthy achievements included the biggest away win (50 at Fiorentina), best defensive record (20 goals conceded, fewest ever in the current league format) in Serie A and second best in the top six European leagues that year.[61] In 201314, Juventus won a third consecutive scudetto with a record 102 points and 33 wins.[62][63] The title was the 30th official league championship in the clubs history.[64] They also achieved the semi-finals of Europa League, where they were eliminated at home against ten-man Benficas catenaccio, missing the final at the Juventus Stadium.[65][66] In 201415, Massimiliano Allegri was appointed as manager, with whom Juventus won their 31st official title, making it a fourth-straight, as well as achieving a record tenth Coppa Italia for the double.[67] The club also beat Real Madrid in the semi finals of the Champions League 32 on aggregate to face Barcelona in the final in Berlin for the first time since the 200203 Champions League.[68] Juventus lost the final to Barcelona 31 after an early fourth-minute goal from Ivan Rakiti, followed by an lvaro Morata equalizer in the 55th minute. Then Barcelona took the lead again with a goal from Luis Surez in the 70th minute, followed by a final minute goal by Neymar as Juventus were caught out on the counterattack.[69] On 14 December 2015, Juventus won the Serie A Football Club of the Year award for the 201415 season, the fourth time in succession.[70] On 25 April 2016, the club won their fifth-straight title (and 32nd overall) since last winning five-straight between 193031 and 193435, after second place Napoli lost to Roma to give Juventus mathematical certainty of the title with three games to spare; last losing to Sassuolo on 25 October 2015, which left them in 12th place, before taking 73 points of a possible 75.[71] On 21 May, the club then won the Coppa Italia for the 11th time and their second-straight title, becoming the first team in Italys history to complete Serie A and Coppa Italia doubles in back-to-back seasons.[72][73][74] On 17 May 2017, Juventus won their 12th Coppa Italia title in a 20 win over Lazio (the first team to win three consecutive championships).[75] Four days later on 21 May, Juventus became the first team to win six consecutive Serie A titles.[76] On 3 June 2017, Juventus entered a second Champions League Final in three years, but were defeated 14 by defending champions Real Madrid  a tragedy in Turin followed.[77][78] Juventus have played in black and white striped shirts, with white shorts, sometimes black shorts since 1903. Originally, they played in pink shirts with a black tie. The father of one of the players made the earliest shirts, but continual washing faded the colour so much that in 1903 the club sought to replace them.[79] Juventus asked one of their team members, Englishman John Savage, if he had any contacts in England who could supply new shirts in a colour that would better withstand the elements. He had a friend who lived in Nottingham, who being a Notts County supporter, shipped out the black and white striped shirts to Turin.[79] Juventus have worn the shirts ever since, considering the colours to be aggressive and powerful.[79] Juventuss official emblem has undergone different and small modifications since the 1920s. The previous modification of the Juventus badge took place in 2004, when the emblem of the team changed to a black-and-white oval shield of a type used by Italian ecclesiastics. It is divided in five vertical stripes: two white stripes and three black stripes, inside which are the following elements, while in its upper section the name of the society superimposed on a white convex section, over golden curvature (gold for honour). The white silhouette of a charging bull is in the lower section of the oval shield, superimposed on a black old French shield and the charging bull is a symbol of the comune of Turin. There is also a black silhouette of a mural crown above the black spherical triangles base. This is a reminiscence to Augusta Tourinorum, the old city of the Roman era which the present capital of Piedmont region is its cultural heiress. In January 2017, president Andrea Agnelli announced the most recent change to the Juventus badge, revealing a video showing the introduction of the new badge. The badge shows the word Juventus on top, with two capital Js shown together in different fonts with a small opening between them to almost make a bigger J. Agnelli said that the badge reflects the Juventus way of living.[80] Juventus was the first team in association football history to adopt a star who added one above their badge in 1958 to represent their tenth Italian Football Championship and Serie A title, at the time and has since become popularized with other clubs as well.[81] In the past, the convex section of the emblem had a blue colour (another symbol of Turin) and, furthermore, its shape was concave. The old French shield and the mural crown, also in the lower section of the emblem, had a considerably greater size with respect to the present. The two Golden Stars for Sport Excellence were located above the convex and concave section of Juventus emblem. During the 1980s, the club emblem was the silhouette of a zebra, to both sides of the equides head, the two golden stars and, above this badge, forming an arc, the clubs name. Juventus unofficially won their 30th league title in 201112, but a dispute with the FIGC, who stripped Juventus of their 200405 and 200506 titles due to their involvement in a 2006 Italian football scandal, left their official total at 28. However, they elected to wear no stars at all the following season.[82] Juventus won their 30th title in 201314 and thus earned the right to wear their third star, but club president Andrea Agnelli stated that the club suspended the use of the stars until another team wins their 20th championship, thus having the right to wear two stars, to emphasise Juventus superiority.[83] However, for the 201516 season, Juventus reintroduced the stars and added the third star to their jersey as well with new kit manufacturers Adidas, in addition to the Coppa Italia badge for winning their tenth Coppa Italia the previous season.[84][85] For the 201617 season, Juventus re-designed their kit with a different take on the trademark white and black stripes.[86] For the 201718 season, Juventus introduced the J shaped logo onto the kits.[87] In September 2015, Juventus officially announced a new project called JKids for its junior supporters on its website. Along with this project, Juventus also introduced a new mascot to all its fans which is called J. J is a cartoon-designed zebra, black and white stripes with golden edge piping on its body, golden shining eyes, and three golden stars on the front of its neck.[88] J made its debut at Juventus Stadium on 12 September 2015.[89] During its history, the club has acquired a number of nicknames, la Vecchia Signora (the Old Lady) being the best example. The old part of the nickname is a pun on Juventus which means youth in Latin. It was derived from the age of the Juventus star players towards the middle of the 1930s. The lady part of the nickname is how fans of the club affectionately referred to it before the 1930s. The club is also nicknamed la Fidanzata dItalia (the Girlfriend of Italy), because over the years it has received a high level of support from Southern Italian immigrant workers (particularly from Naples and Palermo), who arrived in Turin to work for FIAT since the 1930s. Other nicknames include; [La] Madama (Piedmontese for: Madam), i bianconeri (the black-and-whites), le zebre (the zebras)[90] in reference to Juventus colours. I gobbi (the hunchbacks) is the nickname that is used to define Juventus supporters, but is also used sometimes for teams players. The most widely accepted origin of gobbi dates to the fifties, when the bianconeri wore a large jersey. When players ran on the field, the jersey, which had a laced opening at the chest, generated a bulge over the back (a sort of parachute effect), making the players look hunchbacked.[91] The official anthem of Juventus is Juve (storia di un grande amore), or Juve (story of a great love) in English, written by Alessandra Torre and Claudio Guidetti, in the version of the singer and musician Paolo Belli composed in 2007.[92] After the first two years (1897 and 1898), during which Juventus played in the Parco del Valentino and Parco Cittadella, their matches were held in the Piazza dArmi Stadium until 1908, except in 1905 (the first year of the scudetto) and in 1906, years in which it played at the Corso Re Umberto. From 1909 to 1922, Juventus played their internal competitions at Corso Sebastopoli Camp and before moving the following year to Corso Marsiglia Camp, where they remained until 1933, winning four league titles. At the end of 1933, they began to play at the new Stadio Mussolini stadium inaugurated for the 1934 World Championships. After the Second World War, the stadium was renamed as Stadio Comunale Vittorio Pozzo. Juventus played home matches at the ground for 57years, a total of 890league matches.[94] The team continued to host training sessions at the stadium until July 2003.[95] From 1990 until the 200506 season, the Torinese side contested their home matches at Stadio delle Alpi, built for the 1990 FIFA World Cup, although in very rare circumstances the club played some home games in other stadia such as Renzo Barbera at Palermo, Dino Manuzzi at Cesena and the Stadio Giuseppe Meazza at Milan.[95] In August 2006, Juventus returned to play in the Stadio Comunale, then known as Stadio Olimpico, after the restructuring of the stadium for the 2006 Winter Olympics onward. In November 2008, Juventus announced that they would invest around 120million to build a new ground, the Juventus Stadium, on the site of delle Alpi.[96] Unlike the old ground, there is not a running track and instead the pitch is only 7.5 metres away from the stands.[3] The capacity is 41,507.[3] Work began during spring 2009 and the stadium was opened on 8 September 2011, ahead of the start of the 201112 season.[58] Starting on 1 July 2017, the Juventus Stadium will be known as the Allianz Stadium of Turin for six seasons until 30 June 2023.[97] Juventus are the best-supported football club in Italy, with over 12million fans or tifosi, which represent approximately 34 of the total Italian football fans according to a research published in September 2016 by Italian research agency Demos & Pi,[19] as well as one of the most supported football clubs in the world, with over 300million supporters (41million in Europe alone),[20] particularly in the Mediterranean countries to which a large number of Italian diaspora have emigrated.[98] The Torinese side has fan clubs branches across the globe.[99] Demand for Juventus tickets in occasional home games held away from Turin is high, suggesting that Juventus have stronger support in other parts of the country. Juventus is widely and especially popular throughout mainland Southern Italy, Sicily and Malta, leading the team to have one of the largest followings in its away matches,[100] more than in Turin itself. Juventus have significant rivalries with two clubs. Their traditional rivals are fellow Turin club Torino and matches between the two side are known as the Derby della Mole (Turin Derby). The rivalry dates back to 1906 as Torino was founded by break-away Juventus players and staff. Their most high-profile rivalry is with Internazionale, another big Serie A club located in Milan, the capital of the neighbouring region of Lombardy. Matches between these two clubs are referred to as the Derby dItalia (Derby of Italy) and the two regularly challenge each other at the top of the league table, hence the intense rivalry.[101] Until the Calciopoli scandal which saw Juventus forcibly relegated, the two were the only Italian clubs to have never played below Serie A. Notably, the two sides are the first and the second most supported clubs in Italy and the rivalry has intensified since the later part of the 1990s; reaching its highest levels ever post-Calciopoli, with the return of Juventus to Serie A.[101] They also have rivalries with Milan,[102] Roma,[103] Fiorentina[104] and Napoli.[105] The Juventus youth set-up has been recognised as one of the best in Italy for producing young talents.[106] While not all graduates made it to the first team, many have enjoyed successful careers in the Italian top flight. Under long-time coach Vincenzo Chiarenza, the Primavera (Under-20) squad enjoyed one of its successful periods, winning all age-group competitions from 2004 to 2006. Like Dutch club Ajax and many Premier League clubs, Juventus operates several satellite clubs and football schools outside of the country (i.e. United States, Canada, Greece, Saudi Arabia, Australia and Switzerland) and numerous camps in the local region to expand talent scouting.[107] The youth system is also notable for its contribution to the Italian national senior and youth teams. 1934 World Cup winner Gianpiero Combi, 1936 Gold Medal and 1938 World Cup winner Pietro Rava, Giampiero Boniperti, Roberto Bettega, 1982 World Cup hero Paolo Rossi and more recently Claudio Marchisio and Sebastian Giovinco are a number of former graduates who have gone on to make the first team and full Italy squad.[108] Note: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules.

Source: Juventus.com (archive link) Juventus have had numerous chairmen over the course of their history, some of which have been the owners of the club, others have been corporate managers that were nominated by the owners. On top of chairmen, there were several living former chairmen, that were nominated as the honorary chairmen.[131] Below is a list of Juventus managers from 1923, when the Agnelli family took over and the club became more structured and organised,[2] until the present day.[132] Italys most successful club of the 20th century[18] and the most successful club in the history of Italian football,[133] Juventus have won the Italian League Championship, the countrys premier football club competition and organised by Lega Nazionale Professionisti Serie A (LNPA), a record 33 times and have the first two record of consecutive triumphs in that tournament (six, between 201112 and 201617, as well as five between 193031 and 193435).[34][134] They have also won the Coppa Italia, the countrys primary cup competition, a record twelve times, thus becoming the first team to retain the trophy successfully with their triumph in the 195960 season and the first to win it during three consecutive seasons (since the 201415 season to 201617 season).[135] In addition, the club holds the record for Supercoppa Italiana wins with seven, the most recent coming in 2015. Overall, Juventus have won 63official competitions, more than any other team in the country: 52 domestic trophies (which is also a record) and 11 official international competitions,[136] making them, in the latter case, the second most successful Italian club in European competition.[137] The club is fourth in Europe and eighth in the world with the most international titles won officially recognised by their respective association football confederation and Fdration Internationale de Football Association (FIFA).[138] In 1977, the Torinese side become the first in Southern Europe to have won the UEFA Cup and the firstand only to datein Italian football history to achieve an international title with a squad composed by national footballers.[139] In 1993, the club won its third competitions trophy, an unprecedented feat in the continent until then and the most for an Italian club. Juventus was also the first Italian club to achieve the title in the European Super Cup, having won the competition in 1984 and the first European club to win the Intercontinental Cup in 1985, since it was restructured by Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) and Confederacin Sudamericana de Ftbol (CONMEBOL)s organizing committee five years beforehand.[15] The club has earned the distinction of being allowed to wear three Golden Stars (Italian: stelle doro) on its shirts representing its league victories, the tenth of which was achieved during the 195758 season, the twentieth in the 198182 season and the thirtieth in the 201314 season. Juventus were the first Italian team to have achieved the national double four times (winning the Italian top tier division and the national cup competition in the same season), in the 195960, 199495, 201415 and 201516 seasons. In the 201617 season the club won the Coppa Italia for the 12th time, and their third straight title, becoming the first team in Italys history to complete Serie A and Coppa Italia doubles in three consecutive seasons. The club is unique in the world in having won all official confederation competitions[140][141] and they have received, in recognition to winning the three major UEFA competitions[40]first case in the history of the European football and the only one to be reached with the same coach[14] The UEFA Plaque by the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) on 12 July 1988.[142][143] The Torinese side was placed seventhbut the top Italian clubin the FIFAs century ranking of the best clubs in the world on 23 December 2000[17] and nine years later was ranked second best club in Europe during the 20th Century based on a statistical study series by International Federation of Football History & Statistics, the highest for an Italian club in both.[18] Juventus have been proclaimed Worlds Club Team of the Year twice (1993 and 1996)[144] and was ranked in 3rd placethe highest ranking of any Italian clubin the All-Time Club World Ranking (19912009 period) by the IFFHS.[145] Alessandro Del Piero holds Juventus official appearance record of 705 appearances. He took over from Gaetano Scirea on 6 March 2008 against Palermo. He also holds the record for Serie A appearances with 478. Including all official competitions, Del Piero is the all-time leading goalscorer for Juventus, with 290since joining the club in 1993. Giampiero Boniperti, who was the all-time topscorer since 1961 comes in second in all competitions with 182. In the 193334 season, Felice Borel scored 31goals in 34appearances, setting the club record for Serie A goals in a single season. Ferenc Hirzer is the clubs highest scorer in a single season with 35goals in 26appearances in the 192526 season (record of Italian football). The most goals scored by a player in a single match is 6, which is also an Italian record. This was achieved by Omar Svori in a game against Internazionale in the 196061 season.[27] The first ever official game participated in by Juventus was in the Third Federal Football Championship, the predecessor of Serie A, against Torinese in a Juvetus loss 01. The biggest ever victory recorded by Juventus was 150 against Cento, in the second round of the Coppa Italia in the 192627 season. In terms of the league, Fiorentina and Fiumana were famously on the end of the Juventus biggest championship wins, both were beaten 110 and were recorded in the 192829 season. Juventus heaviest championship defeats came during the 191112 and 191213 seasons: they were against Milan in 1912 (18) and Torino in 1913 (08).[27] The intake of Gianluigi Buffon in 2001 from Parma cost Juventus 52 million, making it the most expensive transfer for a goalkeeper of all-time.[159][160][161][162][163] On 20 March 2016, Buffon set a new Serie A record for the longest period without conceding a goal (974 minutes) in the Derby della Mole during the 201516 season.[164] On 26 July 2016, Argentine forward Gonzalo Higuan became the third highest football transfer of all-time and highest ever transfer for an Italian club,[165] when he was signed by Juventus for 90 million from Napoli.[166] On 8 August 2016, Paul Pogba returned to his first club, Manchester United, for an all-time record for highest football transfer fee of 105 million, surpassing the former record holder Gareth Bale.[167] The sale of Zindine Zidane from Juventus to Real Madrid of Spain in 2001 was the world football transfer record at the time, costing the Spanish club around 75 million.[168][169] Overall, Juventus are the club that has contributed the most players to the Italy national team in history,[170] being the only Italian club that has contributed players to every Italy national team since the 2nd FIFA World Cup.[171] Juventus have contributed numerous players to Italys World Cup campaigns, these successful periods principally have coincided with two golden ages of the Turin clubs history, referred as Quinquennio dOro (The Golden Quinquennium), from 1931 until 1935, and Ciclo Leggendario (The Legendary Cycle), from 1972 to 1986. Below are a list of Juventus players who represented the Italy national team during World Cup winning tournaments;[172] Two Juventus players have won the golden boot award at the World Cup with Italy, Paolo Rossi in 1982 and Salvatore Schillaci in 1990. As well as contributing to Italys World Cup winning sides, two Juventus players Alfredo Foni and Pietro Rava, represented Italy in the gold medal winning squad at the 1936 Summer Olympics. Three Juventus players represented their nation during the 1968 European Football Championship win for Italy: Sandro Salvadore, Ernesto Cstano and Giancarlo Bercellino.[173] The Torinese club has also contributed to a lesser degree to the national sides of other nations. Zindine Zidane and captain Didier Deschamps were Juventus players when they won the 1998 World Cup with France, making it as the association football club which supplied the most FIFA World Cup winners globally (24)[174] (three other players in the 1998 squad, Patrick Vieira, David Trezeguet and Lilian Thuram have all played for Juventus at one time or another). Three Juventus players have also won the European Football Championship with a nation other than Italy, Luis del Sol won it in 1964 with Spain, while the Frenchmen Michel Platini and Zidane won the competition in 1984 and 2000 respectively.[175] Since 27 June 1967, Juventus Football Club has been a societ per azioni (S.p.A.)[178] and since 3 December 2001 the Torinese side is listed on the Borsa Italiana.[179] As of 31 December 2015, the Juventus shares are distributed between 63.8 to EXOR N.V., the Agnelli familys holding (a company of the Giovanni Agnelli and C.S.a.p.a Group), 5.0 to Lindsell Train Ltd. and 31.2 to other shareholders.(<2.0)[180][181] As of 5 July 2016, Lindsell Train Ltd. increased its holding to 10 and then Exor S.P.A decreased to 60.0.[182][183] Since 2012, Jeep became the new sponsor of Juventus, a car brand acquired by FIAT after the 2000s Global Financial Crisis. Along with Lazio and Roma, Juventus is one of only three Italian clubs quoted on Borsa Italiana (Italian stock exchange). Juventus was also the only association football club in the country member of STAR (Segment of Stocks conforming to High Requirements, Italian: Segmento Titoli con Alti Requisiti), one of the main market segment in the world.[184] However, due to 2011 financial results, Juventus had to move from the STAR segment to MTA market.[185] The clubs training ground was owned by Campi di Vinovo S.p.A, controlled by Juventus Football Club S.p.A. to 71.3.[186] In 2003, the club bought the lands from the subsidiary[187] and later the company was dissolved. Since then, Juventus did not had any subsidiary. From 1 July 2008, the club has implemented a safety management system for employees and athletes in compliance with the requirements of international OHSAS 18001:2007 regulation[188] and a Safety Management System in the medical sector according to the international ISO 9001:2000 resolution.[189] The club is one of the founders of the European Club Association (ECA), which was formed after the dissolution of the G-14, an international group of Europes most elite clubs of which Juventus were also a founding member.[190] According to the Deloitte Football Money League, a research published by consultants Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu on 17 January 2014, Juventus are the ninth-highest earning football club in the world with an estimated revenue of 272.4million, the most for an Italian club.[191] The club is also ranked ninth on Forbes list of the most valuable football clubs in the world with an estimate value of US$850million (654million), making them the second richest association football club in Italy. The club was located in 2012 in top 50 sporting teams at worldwide level in terms of value.[192][193] Juventus re-capitalized on 28 June 2007, increased 104,807,731.60 shares capital.[194] The team made an aggregate net loss in the following seasons (2006 to date): 927,569 (200607),[194] 20,787,469 (200708),[195] net income 6,582,489 (200809)[196] and net loss 10,967,944 (200910).[197] After an unaudited 43,411,481 net loss was recorded in the first nine months of 201011 season,[198] the board of directors announced that a capital increase of 120million was planned, scheduled to submit to the extraordinary shareholders meeting in October.[199] Eventually, the 201011 season net loss was 95,414,019.[200] In the 201213 season, Juventus continued to recover from recent seasons net losses thanks to the biggest payment in UEFAs Champions League 201213 revenue distribution, earning 65.3million. Despite being knocked out in the quarterfinal stage, Juventus took the lions share thanks to the largesse of the Italian national TV market and the division of revenues with the only other Italian team attended at the competitions final phase, Milan.[201] Confirming the trend of marked improvement in net result, the 201314 financial year closed with a loss of 6.7 million, but with the first positive operating income since 2006.[202] In the 201415 season, by the excellent sports results achieved (the fourth year in a row of Serie A titles, the tenth Coppa Italia title and playing the Champions League final), net income reached at 2.3million. Compared to the loss of 6.7million last year, 201415 showed a positive change of 9million and returned to a profit after six years since 200809.[203]

League, the top flight of English football. The club has won 13 League titles, a record 13 FA Cups, two League Cups, the League Centenary Trophy, 14 FA Community Shields, one UEFA Cup Winners Cup and one Inter-Cities Fairs Cup. Arsenal was the first club from the South of England to join The Football League, in 1893. They entered the First Division in 1904, and have since accumulated the second most points.[3] Relegated only once, in 1913, they continue the longest streak in the top division.[4] In the 1930s, Arsenal won five League Championships and two FA Cups, and another FA Cup and two Championships after the war. In 197071, they won their first League and FA Cup Double. Between 1989 and 2005, they won five League titles and five FA Cups, including two more Doubles. They completed the 20th century with the highest average league position.[5] Herbert Chapman won Arsenals first national trophies, but died prematurely. He helped introduce the WM formation, floodlights, and shirt numbers,[6] and added the white sleeves and brighter red to Arsenals kit. Arsne Wenger has been the longest-serving manager and has won the most trophies. His teams set several English records: the longest win streak; the longest unbeaten run; and the only 38 match season unbeaten. In 1886, Woolwich munitions workers founded the club as Dial Square. In 1913, the club crossed the city to Arsenal Stadium in Highbury. They became Tottenham Hotspurs nearest club, commencing the North London derby. In 2006, they moved down the road to the Emirates Stadium. Arsenal earned 435.5m in 201415, with the Emirates Stadium generating the highest revenue in world football.[7] Based on social media activity from 201415, Arsenals fanbase is the fifth largest in the world.[7] In 2016, Forbes estimated the club was the second most valuable in England, worth $2.0 billion.[8]   On 1 December 1886, munitions workers in Woolwich, now South East London, formed Arsenal as Dial Square, with David Danskin as their first captain.[9] Named after the heart of the Royal Arsenal complex, they took the name of the whole complex a month later.[10][11] Royal Arsenal F.C.s first home was Plumstead Common,[11] though they spent most of their time in South East London playing on the other side of Plumstead, at the Manor Ground. Royal Arsenal won Arsenals first trophies in 1890 and 1891, and these were the only football association trophies Arsenal won during their time in South East London.[12][13] Royal Arsenal renamed themselves for a second time upon becoming a limited liability company in 1893. They registered their new name, Woolwich Arsenal, with The Football League when the club ascended later that year.[14][15] Woolwich Arsenal was the first southern member of The Football League, starting out in the Second Division and winning promotion to the First Division in 1904. Falling attendances, due to financial difficulties among the munitions workers and the arrival of more accessible football clubs elsewhere in the city, led the club close to bankruptcy by 1910.[16][17] Businessmen Henry Norris and William Hall took the club over, and sought to move them elsewhere. In 1913, soon after relegation back to the Second Division, Woolwich Arsenal moved to the new Arsenal Stadium in Highbury, North London. This saw their third change of name: the following year, they reduced Woolwich Arsenal to simply The Arsenal.[18][19] In 1919, The Football League voted to promote The Arsenal, instead of relegated local rivals Tottenham Hotspur, into the newly enlarged First Division, despite only listing the club sixth in the Second Divisions last pre-war season of 191415. Some books have speculated that the club won this election to division one by dubious means.[20] Later that year, The Arsenal started dropping The in official documents, gradually shifting its name for the final time towards Arsenal, as it is generally known today.[21] With a new home and First Division football, attendances were more than double those at the Manor Ground, and Arsenals budget grew rapidly.[22][23] Their location and record-breaking salary offer lured star Huddersfield Town manager Herbert Chapman in 1925.[24][25] Over the next five years, Chapman built a new Arsenal. He appointed enduring new trainer Tom Whittaker,[26] implemented Charlie Buchans new twist on the nascent WM formation,[27][28] captured young players like Cliff Bastin and Eddie Hapgood, and lavished Highburys income on stars like David Jack and Alex James. With record-breaking spending and gate receipts, Arsenal quickly became known as the Bank of England club.[29][30] Transformed, Chapmans Arsenal claimed their first national trophy, the FA Cup, in 1930. Two League Championships followed, in 193031 and 193233.[31] Chapman also presided over multiple off the pitch changes: white sleeves and shirt numbers were added to the kit;[32] a Tube station was named after the club;[33][34] and the first of two opulent, Art Deco stands was completed, with some of the first floodlights in English football.[23] Suddenly, in the middle of the 193334 season, Chapman died of pneumonia.[35] His work was left to Joe Shaw and George Allison, who saw out a hat-trick with the 193334 and 193435 titles, and then won the 1936 FA Cup and 193738 title. World War II meant The Football League was suspended for seven years, but Arsenal returned to win it in the second post-war season, 194748. This was Tom Whittakers first season as manager, after his promotion to succeed Allison, and the club had equalled the champions of England record. They won a third FA Cup in 1950, and then won a record-breaking seventh championship in 195253.[36] However, the war had taken its toll on Arsenal. The club had had more players killed than any top flight club,[37] and debt from reconstructing the North Bank Stand bled Arsenals resources.[23][19] Arsenal were not to win the League or the FA Cup for another 18 years. The 53 Champions squad was old, and the club failed to attract strong enough replacements.[38] Although Arsenal were competitive during these years, their fortunes had waned; the club spent most of the 1950s and 1960s in midleague mediocrity.[39] Even former England captain Billy Wright could not bring the club any success as manager, in a stint between 1962 and 1966.[40] Arsenal tentatively appointed club physiotherapist Bertie Mee as acting manager in 1966.[41][42] With new assistant Don Howe and new players such as Bob McNab and George Graham, Mee led Arsenal to their first League Cup finals, in 196768 and 196869. Next season saw a breakthrough: Arsenals first competitive European trophy, the 196970 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup. And the season after, an even greater triumph: Arsenals first League and FA Cup double, and a new champions of England record.[43] This marked a premature high point of the decade; the Double-winning side was soon broken up and the rest of the decade was characterised by a series of near misses, starting with Arsenal finishing as FA Cup runners up in 1972, and First Division runners-up in 197273.[42] Former player Terry Neill succeeded Mee in 1976. At the age of 34, he became the youngest Arsenal manager to date.[44] With new signings like Malcolm Macdonald and Pat Jennings, and a crop of talent in the side such as Liam Brady and Frank Stapleton, the club reached a trio of FA Cup finals (1978, 1979 and 1980), and lost the 1980 European Cup Winners Cup Final on penalties. The clubs only trophy during this time was a last-minute 32 victory over Manchester United in the 1979 FA Cup Final, widely regarded as a classic.[45][46] One of Bertie Mees double winners, George Graham, returned as manager in 1986. Arsenal won their first League Cup in 1987, Grahams first season in charge. By 1988, new signings Nigel Winterburn, Lee Dixon and Steve Bould had joined the club to complete the famous Back Four led by existing player Tony Adams.[47] They immediately won the 1988 Football League Centenary Trophy, and followed it with the 198889 Football League title, snatched with a last-minute goal in the final game of the season against fellow title challengers Liverpool.[48] Grahams Arsenal won another title in 199091, losing only one match, won the FA Cup and League Cup double in 1993, and the European Cup Winners Cup, in 1994. Grahams reputation was tarnished when he was found to have taken kickbacks from agent Rune Hauge for signing certain players,[49] and he was dismissed in 1995. His permanent replacement, Bruce Rioch, lasted for only one season, leaving the club after a dispute with the board of directors.[50] The club metamorphosed during the long tenure of manager Arsne Wenger, appointed in 1996. New, attacking football,[51] an overhaul of dietary and fitness practices,[52] and efficiency with money[53] have defined his reign. Accumulating key players from Wengers homeland, such as Patrick Vieira and Thierry Henry, Arsenal won a second League and Cup double in 199798 and a third in 200102. In addition, the club reached the final of the 19992000 UEFA Cup, were victorious in the 2003 and 2005 FA Cups, and won the Premier League in 200304 without losing a single match, an achievement which earned the side the nickname The Invincibles.[54] This latter feat came within a run of 49 league matches unbeaten from 7 May 2003 to 24 October 2004, a national record.[55] Arsenal finished in either first or second place in the league in eight of Wengers first nine seasons at the club, although on no occasion were they able to retain the title.[56] The club had never progressed beyond the quarter-finals of the Champions League until 200506; in that season they became the first club from London in the competitions fifty-year history to reach the final, in which they were beaten 21 by Barcelona.[57] In July 2006, they moved into the Emirates Stadium, after 93 years at Highbury.[58] Arsenal reached the final of the 2007 and 2011 League Cups, losing 21 to Chelsea and Birmingham City respectively. The club had not gained a major trophy since the 2005 FA Cup until 17 May 2014, when Arsenal beat Hull City in the 2014 FA Cup Final, coming back from a 20 deficit to win the match 32.[59] This qualified them for the 2014 FA Community Shield where they would play Premier League champions Manchester City. They recorded a resounding 30 win in the game, winning their second trophy in three months.[60] Nine months after their Community Shield triumph, Arsenal appeared in the FA Cup final for the second year in a row, defeating Aston Villa 40 in the final and becoming the most successful club in the tournaments history with 12 titles, a record which Manchester United would tie the following season.[61] On 2 August 2015, Arsenal beat Chelsea 10 at Wembley Stadium to retain the Community Shield and earn their 14th Community Shield title.[62] The season after their Community Shield win, Arsenal won yet another trophy as they claimed the FA Cup for a record 13th time, defeating Chelsea 21 in the final and once more becoming the outright leader in terms of FA Cups won. The victory also saw Arsne Wenger become the first manager in English football history to win seven FA Cups. However in that same season, Arsenal finished in fifth position in the league, the first time they had finished outside the top four since before Wenger arrived in 1996.[63] Unveiled in 1888, Royal Arsenals first crest featured three cannons viewed from above, pointing northwards, similar to the coat of arms of the Metropolitan Borough of Woolwich (nowadays transferred to the coat of arms of the Royal Borough of Greenwich). These can sometimes be mistaken for chimneys, but the presence of a carved lions head and a cascabel on each are clear indicators that they are cannons.[64] This was dropped after the move to Highbury in 1913, only to be reinstated in 1922, when the club adopted a crest featuring a single cannon, pointing eastwards, with the clubs nickname, The Gunners, inscribed alongside it; this crest only lasted until 1925, when the cannon was reversed to point westward and its barrel slimmed down.[64] In 1949, the club unveiled a modernised crest featuring the same style of cannon below the clubs name, set in blackletter, and above the coat of arms of the Metropolitan Borough of Islington and a scroll inscribed with the clubs newly adopted Latin motto, Victoria Concordia Crescit - victory comes from harmony  coined by the clubs programme editor Harry Homer.[64] For the first time, the crest was rendered in colour, which varied slightly over the crests lifespan, finally becoming red, gold and green. Because of the numerous revisions of the crest, Arsenal were unable to copyright it. Although the club had managed to register the crest as a trademark, and had fought (and eventually won) a long legal battle with a local street trader who sold unofficial Arsenal merchandise,[65] Arsenal eventually sought a more comprehensive legal protection. Therefore, in 2002 they introduced a new crest featuring more modern curved lines and a simplified style, which was copyrightable.[66] The cannon once again faces east and the clubs name is written in a sans-serif typeface above the cannon. Green was replaced by dark blue. The new crest was criticised by some supporters; the Arsenal Independent Supporters Association claimed that the club had ignored much of Arsenals history and tradition with such a radical modern design, and that fans had not been properly consulted on the issue.[67] Until the 1960s, a badge was worn on the playing shirt only for high-profile matches such as FA Cup finals, usually in the form of a monogram of the clubs initials in red on a white background.[68] The monogram theme was developed into an Art Deco-style badge on which the letters A and C framed a football rather than the letter F, the whole set within a hexagonal border. This early example of a corporate logo, introduced as part of Herbert Chapmans rebranding of the club in the 1930s, was used not only on Cup Final shirts but as a design feature throughout Highbury Stadium, including above the main entrance and inlaid in the floors.[69] From 1967, a white cannon was regularly worn on the shirts, until replaced by the club crest, sometimes with the addition of the nickname The Gunners, in the 1990s.[68] In the 201112 season, Arsenal celebrated their 125th year anniversary. The celebrations included a modified version of the current crest worn on their jerseys for the season. The crest was all white, surrounded by 15 oak leaves to the right and 15 laurel leaves to the left. The oak leaves represent the 15 founding members of the club who met at the Royal Oak pub. The 15 laurel leaves represent the design detail on the six pence pieces paid by the founding fathers to establish the club. The laurel leaves also represent strength. To complete the crest, 1886 and 2011 are shown on either sides of the motto Forward at the bottom of the crest.[70] For much of Arsenals history, their home colours have been bright red shirts with white sleeves and white shorts, though this has not always been the case. The choice of red is in recognition of a charitable donation from Nottingham Forest, soon after Arsenals foundation in 1886. Two of Dial Squares founding members, Fred Beardsley and Morris Bates, were former Forest players who had moved to Woolwich for work. As they put together the first team in the area, no kit could be found, so Beardsley and Bates wrote home for help and received a set of kit and a ball.[71] The shirt was redcurrant, a dark shade of red, and was worn with white shorts and socks with blue and white hoops.[72][73] In 1933, Herbert Chapman, wanting his players to be more distinctly dressed, updated the kit, adding white sleeves and changing the shade to a brighter pillar box red. Two possibilities have been suggested for the origin of the white sleeves. One story reports that Chapman noticed a supporter in the stands wearing a red sleeveless sweater over a white shirt; another was that he was inspired by a similar outfit worn by the cartoonist Tom Webster, with whom Chapman played golf.[74] Regardless of which story is true, the red and white shirts have come to define Arsenal and the team have worn the combination ever since, aside from two seasons. The first was 196667, when Arsenal wore all-red shirts;[73] this proved unpopular and the white sleeves returned the following season. The second was 200506, the last season that Arsenal played at Highbury, when the team wore commemorative redcurrant shirts similar to those worn in 1913, their first season in the stadium; the club reverted to their normal colours at the start of the next season.[74] In the 200809 season, Arsenal replaced the traditional all-white sleeves with red sleeves with a broad white stripe.[73] Arsenals home colours have been the inspiration for at least three other clubs. In 1909, Sparta Prague adopted a dark red kit like the one Arsenal wore at the time;[74] in 1938, Hibernian adopted the design of the Arsenal shirt sleeves in their own green and white strip.[75] In 1920, Sporting Clube de Bragas manager returned from a game at Highbury and changed his teams green kit to a duplicate of Arsenals red with white sleeves and shorts, giving rise to the teams nickname of Os Arsenalistas.[76] These teams still wear those designs to this day. For many years Arsenals away colours were white shirts and either black or white shorts. In the 196970 season, Arsenal introduced an away kit of yellow shirts with blue shorts. This kit was worn in the 1971 FA Cup Final as Arsenal beat Liverpool to secure the double for the first time in their history.[77] Arsenal reached the FA Cup final again the following year wearing the red and white home strip and were beaten by Leeds United. Arsenal then competed in three consecutive FA Cup finals between 1978 and 1980 wearing their lucky yellow and blue strip,[77] which remained the clubs away strip until the release of a green and navy away kit in 198283. The following season, Arsenal returned to the yellow and blue scheme, albeit with a darker shade of blue than before. When Nike took over from Adidas as Arsenals kit provider in 1994, Arsenals away colours were again changed to two-tone blue shirts and shorts. Since the advent of the lucrative replica kit market, the away kits have been changed regularly, with Arsenal usually releasing both away and third choice kits. During this period the designs have been either all blue designs, or variations on the traditional yellow and blue, such as the metallic gold and navy strip used in the 200102 season, the yellow and dark grey used from 2005 to 2007, and the yellow and maroon of 2010 to 2013.[78] Until 2014, the away kit was changed every season, and the outgoing away kit became the third-choice kit if a new home kit was being introduced in the same year.[79] Since Puma began manufacturing Arsenals kits in 2014, new home, away and third kits are released every single season.[80] Arsenals shirts have been made by manufacturers including Bukta (from the 1930s until the early 1970s), Umbro (from the 1970s until 1986), Adidas (19861994), Nike (19942014), and Puma (from 2014).[81] Like those of most other major football clubs, Arsenals shirts have featured sponsors logos since the 1980s; sponsors include JVC (19821999), Sega (19992002), O2 (20022006), and Emirates (from 2006).[73][74] For most of their time in south-east London, Arsenal played at the Manor Ground in Plumstead, apart from a three-year period at the nearby Invicta Ground between 1890 and 1893. The Manor Ground was initially just a field, until the club installed stands and terracing for their first Football League match in September 1893. They played their home games there for the next twenty years (with two exceptions in the 189495 season), until the move to north London in 1913.[82][83] Widely referred to as Highbury, Arsenal Stadium was the clubs home from September 1913 until May 2006. The original stadium was designed by the renowned football architect Archibald Leitch, and had a design common to many football grounds in the UK at the time, with a single covered stand and three open-air banks of terracing.[23] The entire stadium was given a massive overhaul in the 1930s: new Art Deco West and East stands were constructed, opening in 1932 and 1936 respectively, and a roof was added to the North Bank terrace, which was bombed during the Second World War and not restored until 1954.[23] Highbury could hold more than 60,000 spectators at its peak, and had a capacity of 57,000 until the early 1990s. The Taylor Report and Premier League regulations obliged Arsenal to convert Highbury to an all-seater stadium in time for the 199394 season, thus reducing the capacity to 38,419 seated spectators.[84] This capacity had to be reduced further during Champions League matches to accommodate additional advertising boards, so much so that for two seasons, from 1998 to 2000, Arsenal played Champions League home matches at Wembley, which could house more than 70,000 spectators.[85] Expansion of Highbury was restricted because the East Stand had been designated as a Grade II listed building and the other three stands were close to residential properties.[23] These limitations prevented the club from maximising matchday revenue during the 1990s and first decade of the 21st century, putting them in danger of being left behind in the football boom of that time.[86] After considering various options, in 2000 Arsenal proposed building a new 60,361-capacity stadium at Ashburton Grove, since named the Emirates Stadium, about 500metres south-west of Highbury.[87] The project was initially delayed by red tape and rising costs,[88] and construction was completed in July 2006, in time for the start of the 200607 season.[89] The stadium was named after its sponsors, the airline company Emirates, with whom the club signed the largest sponsorship deal in English football history, worth around 100million.[90] Some fans referred to the ground as Ashburton Grove, or the Grove, as they did not agree with corporate sponsorship of stadium names.[91] The stadium will be officially known as Emirates Stadium until at least 2028, and the airline will be the clubs shirt sponsor until the end of the 201819 season.[92] From the start of the 201011 season on, the stands of the stadium have been officially known as North Bank, East Stand, West Stand and Clock end.[93] Arsenals players train at the Shenley Training Centre in Hertfordshire, a purpose-built facility which opened in 1999.[94] Before that the club used facilities on a nearby site owned by the University College of London Students Union. Until 1961 they had trained at Highbury.[95] Arsenals Academy under-18 teams play their home matches at Shenley, while the reserves play their games at Meadow Park,[96] which is also the home of Boreham Wood F.C.. Arsenal fans often refer to themselves as Gooners, the name derived from the teams nickname, The Gunners. The fanbase is large and generally loyal, and virtually all home matches sell out; in 200708 Arsenal had the second-highest average League attendance for an English club (60,070, which was 99.5 of available capacity),[97] and, as of 2015, the third-highest all-time average attendance.[98] Arsenal have the seventh highest average attendance of European football clubs only behind Borussia Dortmund, FC Barcelona, Manchester United, Real Madrid, Bayern Munich, and Schalke.[99][100][101][102] The clubs location, adjoining wealthy areas such as Canonbury and Barnsbury, mixed areas such as Islington, Holloway, Highbury, and the adjacent London Borough of Camden, and largely working-class areas such as Finsbury Park and Stoke Newington, has meant that Arsenals supporters have come from a variety of social classes. Like all major English football clubs, Arsenal have a number of domestic supporters clubs, including the Arsenal Football Supporters Club, which works closely with the club, and the Arsenal Independent Supporters Association, which maintains a more independent line. The Arsenal Supporters Trust promotes greater participation in ownership of the club by fans. The clubs supporters also publish fanzines such as The Gooner, Gunflash and the satirical Up The Arse!. In addition to the usual English football chants, supporters sing One-Nil to the Arsenal (to the tune of Go West). There have always been Arsenal supporters outside London, and since the advent of satellite television, a supporters attachment to a football club has become less dependent on geography. Consequently, Arsenal have a significant number of fans from beyond London and all over the world; in 2007, 24 UK, 37 Irish and 49 other overseas supporters clubs were affiliated with the club.[103] A 2011 report by SPORT+MARKT estimated Arsenals global fanbase at 113 million.[104] The clubs social media activity was the fifth highest in world football during the 201415 season.[7] Arsenals longest-running and deepest rivalry is with their nearest major neighbours, Tottenham Hotspur; matches between the two are referred to as North London derbies.[105] Other rivalries within London include those with Chelsea, Fulham and West Ham United. In addition, Arsenal and Manchester United developed a strong on-pitch rivalry in the late 1980s, which intensified in recent years when both clubs were competing for the Premier League title[106] so much so that a 2003 online poll by the Football Fans Census listed Manchester United as Arsenals biggest rivals, followed by Tottenham and Chelsea.[107] A 2008 poll listed the Tottenham rivalry as more important.[108] The largest shareholder on the Arsenal board is American sports tycoon Stan Kroenke.[109] Kroenke first launched a bid for the club in April 2007,[110] and faced competition for shares from Red and White Securities, which acquired its first shares off David Dein in August 2007.[111] Red & White Securities was co-owned by Russian billionaire Alisher Usmanov and Iranian London-based financier Farhad Moshiri, though Usmanov bought Moshiris stake in 2016.[112] Kroenke came close to the 30 takeover threshold in November 2009, when he increased his holding to 18,594 shares (29.9).[113][114] In April 2011, Kroenke achieved a full takeover by purchasing the shareholdings of Nina Bracewell-Smith and Danny Fiszman, taking his shareholding to 62.89.[115][116] As of May 2017, Kroenke owns 41,721 shares (67.05) and Red & White Securities own 18,695 shares (30.04).[109] Ivan Gazidis has been the clubs Chief Executive since 2009.[109] Arsenals parent company, Arsenal Holdings plc, operates as a non-quoted public limited company, whose ownership is considerably different from that of other football clubs. Only 62,219 shares in Arsenal have been issued,[109] and they are not traded on a public exchange such as the FTSE or AIM; instead, they are traded relatively infrequently on the ICAP Securities and Derivatives Exchange, a specialist market. On 29 May 2017, a single share in Arsenal had a mid price of 18,000, which sets the clubs market capitalisation value at approximately 1,119.9m.[117] Most football clubs arent listed on an exchange, which makes direct comparisons of their values difficult. Consultants Brand Finance valued the clubs brand and intangible assets at $703m in 2015, and consider Arsenal an AAA global brand.[118] Business magazine Forbes valued Arsenal as a whole at $2.0 billion (1.4 billion) in 2016, ranked second in English football.[8] Research by the Henley Business School also ranked Arsenal second in English football, modelling the clubs value at 1.118 billion in 2015.[119][120] Arsenals financial results for the 201415 season show group revenue of 344.5m, with a profit before tax of 24.7m.[121] The footballing core of the business showed a revenue of 329.3m. The Deloitte Football Money League is a publication that homogenizes and compares clubs annual revenue. They put Arsenals footballing revenue at 331.3m (435.5m), ranking Arsenal seventh among world football clubs.[7] Arsenal and Deloitte both list the match day revenue generated by the Emirates Stadium as 100.4m, more than any other football stadium in the world. Arsenal have appeared in a number of media firsts. On 22 January 1927, their match at Highbury against Sheffield United was the first English League match to be broadcast live on radio.[122][123] A decade later, on 16 September 1937, an exhibition match between Arsenals first team and the reserves was the first football match in the world to be televised live.[122][124] Arsenal also featured in the first edition of the BBCs Match of the Day, which screened highlights of their match against Liverpool at Anfield on 22 August 1964.[122][125] BSkyBs coverage of Arsenals January 2010 match against Manchester United was the first live public broadcast of a sports event on 3D television.[122][126] As one of the most successful teams in the country, Arsenal have often featured when football is depicted in the arts in Britain. They formed the backdrop to one of the earliest football-related films, The Arsenal Stadium Mystery (1939).[127] The film centres on a friendly match between Arsenal and an amateur side, one of whose players is poisoned while playing. Many Arsenal players appeared as themselves and manager George Allison was given a speaking part.[128] More recently, the book Fever Pitch by Nick Hornby was an autobiographical account of Hornbys life and relationship with football and Arsenal in particular. Published in 1992, it formed part of the revival and rehabilitation of football in British society during the 1990s.[129] The book was twice adapted for the cinema the 1997 British film focuses on Arsenals 198889 title win,[130] and a 2005 American version features a fan of baseballs Boston Red Sox;[131] coincidentally the ending was re-made to feature the 200405 season that ended in a similar fashion. Arsenal have often been stereotyped as a defensive and boring side, especially during the 1970s and 1980s;[132][133] many comedians, such as Eric Morecambe, made jokes about this at the teams expense. The theme was repeated in the 1997 film The Full Monty, in a scene where the lead actors move in a line and raise their hands, deliberately mimicking the Arsenal defences offside trap, in an attempt to co-ordinate their striptease routine.[128] Another film reference to the clubs defence comes in the film Plunkett & Macleane, in which two characters are named Dixon and Winterburn after Arsenals long-serving full backs the right-sided Lee Dixon and the left-sided Nigel Winterburn.[128] The 1991 television comedy sketch show Harry Enfield & Chums featured a sketch from the characters Mr Cholmondly-Warner and Grayson where the Arsenal team of 1933, featuring exaggerated parodies of fictitious amateur players take on the Liverpool team of 1991.[134] In the 2007 movie, Goal II: Living the Dream, there is a fictional UEFA Champions League final between Real Madrid against Arsenal. In 1985, Arsenal founded a community scheme, Arsenal in the Community, which offered sporting, social inclusion, educational and charitable projects. The club support a number of charitable causes directly and in 1992 established The Arsenal Charitable Trust, which by 2006 had raised more than 2million for local causes.[135] An ex-professional and celebrity football team associated with the club also raised money by playing charity matches.[136] In the 200910 season Arsenal announced that they had raised a record breaking 818,897 for the Great Ormond Street Hospital Childrens Charity. The original target was 500,000.[137] Save the Children has been Arsenal global charity partner since 2011 and have worked together in numerous projects to improve safety and well-being for vulnerable children in London and abroad. On September 3, 2016 The Arsenal Foundation has donated 1m to build football pitches for children in London, Iraq, Jordan and Somalia thanks to The Arsenal Foundation Legends Match against Milan Glorie at the Emirates Stadium.[138] Arsenals tally of 13 League Championships is the third highest in English football, after Manchester United (20) and Liverpool (18),[139] and they were the first club to reach a seventh and an eighth League Championship. As of May 2016, they are one of only six teams, the others being Manchester United, Blackburn Rovers, Chelsea, Manchester City and Leicester City, to have won the Premier League since its formation in 1992.[140] They hold the highest number of FA Cup trophies, with 13.[141] The club is one of only six clubs to have won the FA Cup twice in succession, in 2002 and 2003, and 2014 and 2015.[142] Arsenal have achieved three League and FA Cup Doubles (in 1971, 1998 and 2002), a feat only previously achieved by Manchester United (in 1994, 1996 and 1999).[56][143] They were the first side in English football to complete the FA Cup and League Cup double, in 1993.[144] Arsenal were also the first London club to reach the final of the UEFA Champions League, in 2006, losing the final 21 to Barcelona.[145] Arsenal have one of the best top-flight records in history, having finished below fourteenth only seven times. The league wins and points they have accumulated are the second most in English top flight football.[3] They have been in the top flight for the most consecutive seasons (92 as of 201718).[4][146] Arsenal also have the highest average league finishing position for the 20th century, with an average league placement of 8.5.[5] Arsenal hold the record for the longest run of unbeaten League matches (49 between May 2003 and October 2004).[55] This included all 38 matches of their title-winning 200304 season, when Arsenal became only the second club to finish a top-flight campaign unbeaten, after Preston North End (who played only 22 matches) in 188889.[54][147] They also hold the record for the longest top flight win streak.[148] Arsenal set a Champions League record during the 200506 season by going ten matches without conceding a goal, beating the previous best of seven set by A.C. Milan. They went a record total stretch of 995minutes without letting an opponent score; the streak ended in the final, when Samuel Etoo scored a 76th-minute equaliser for Barcelona.[57] David OLeary holds the record for Arsenal appearances, having played 722 first-team matches between 1975 and 1993. Fellow centre half and former captain Tony Adams comes second, having played 669 times. The record for a goalkeeper is held by David Seaman, with 564 appearances.[149] Thierry Henry is the clubs top goalscorer with 228 goals in all competitions between 1999 and 2012,[150] having surpassed Ian Wrights total of 185 in October 2005.[151] Wrights record had stood since September 1997, when he overtook the longstanding total of 178 goals set by winger Cliff Bastin in 1939.[152] Henry also holds the club record for goals scored in the League, with 175,[150] a record that had been held by Bastin until February 2006.[153] Arsenals record home attendance is 73,707, for a UEFA Champions League match against RC Lens on 25 November 1998 at Wembley Stadium, where the club formerly played home European matches because of the limits on Highburys capacity. The record attendance for an Arsenal match at Highbury is 73,295, for a 00 draw against Sunderland on 9 March 1935,[149] while that at Emirates Stadium is 60,161, for a 22 draw with Manchester United on 3 November 2007.[154] Note: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules.

There have been eighteen permanent and five caretaker managers of Arsenal since the appointment of the clubs first professional manager, Thomas Mitchell in 1897.[168] The clubs longest-serving manager, in terms of both length of tenure and number of games overseen, is Arsne Wenger, who was appointed in 1996.[169][170] Wenger is also Arsenals only manager from outside the United Kingdom.[170] Two Arsenal managers have died in the job Herbert Chapman and Tom Whittaker.[171] As of 28 May 2017.[172] Seasons in bold are seasons when the club won a Double of the league and FA Cup, or of the FA Cup and League Cup. The 200304 season was the only 38-match league season unbeaten in English football history. A special gold version of the Premier League trophy was commissioned and presented to the club the following season.[173] Arsenal Ladies are the womens football club affiliated to Arsenal. Founded in 1987 by Vic Akers, they turned semi-professional in 2002 and are managed by Clare Wheatley. Akers now assumes the role of Honorary President of Arsenal Ladies.[174][175] Arsenal Ladies are the most successful team in English womens football. In the 200809 season, they won all three major English trophies the FA Womens Premier League, FA Womens Cup and FA Womens Premier League Cup,[176] and, as of 2009, were the only English side to have won the UEFA Womens Cup, having done so in the 200607 season as part of a unique quadruple.[177] The mens and womens clubs are formally separate entities but have quite close ties; Arsenal Ladies are entitled to play once a season at the Emirates Stadium, though they usually play their home matches at Boreham Wood.[178] At present the ladies have won 42 trophies in their 28-year history.[179]

competes in the Premier League. The clubs home for the 201718 season will be Wembley Stadium, as their former home of White Hart Lane is being dismantled to make way for a completely new rebuilt stadium on the same site. Their newly developed training ground is in Bulls Cross on the northern borders of the London Borough of Enfield. Founded in 1882, Tottenham won the FA Cup for the first time in 1901, making them the only non-League club to do so since the formation of the Football League in 1888. Tottenham were the first club in the 20th century to achieve the League and FA Cup Double, winning both competitions in the 196061 season. After successfully defending the FA Cup in 1962, in 1963 they became the first British club to win a UEFA club competition the European Cup Winners Cup.[6] In 1967, Spurs won the FA Cup for a third time in the 1960s. In the 1970s Tottenham won the League Cup on two occasions and were the inaugural winner of the UEFA Cup in 1972, becoming the first British club to win two different major European trophies. In the 1980s Spurs won several trophies: the FA Cup twice, FA Community Shield and the UEFA Cup in 1984. In the 1990s the club won the FA Cup and the League Cup. When they won the League Cup once more in 2008, it meant that they had won a major trophy in each of the last six decades an achievement only matched by Manchester United. The clubs Latin motto is Audere est Facere (lit: To Dare Is to Do), and its emblem is a cockerel standing upon a football. The club has a long-standing rivalry with nearby neighbours Arsenal, with head-to-head fixtures known as the North London derby.   The club was formed in 1882, as Hotspur F.C., and played in the Southern League from 1896 until 1908, when they were elected into the Football League Second Division. Before this promotion Tottenham had won the FA Cup in 1901, making them the only non-League club to (or likely to) do so since the formation of the Football League. Since then, Tottenham have won the FA Cup a further seven times, the Football League twice, the Football League Cup four times, the UEFA Cup twice and also the UEFA Cup Winners Cup. The Cup Winners Cup victory in 1963 made Tottenham the first English team to win a UEFA competition. In 196061 they became the first team to complete The Double in the 20th century. Tottenham played their first matches at Tottenham Marshes on the available public pitches and remained there for six years. It was at this ground that Spurs first played archrivals Arsenal (then known as Royal Arsenal), leading 21 until the match got called off due to poor light after the away team arrived late.[7] There were occasions on which fights would break out on the marshes in dispute of the teams that were allowed to use the best pitches. Crowd sizes were regularly increasing and a new site was becoming needed to accommodate these supporters. In 1888 the club moved from the marshes to Northumberland Park and charged an admission fee of 3d (0.0125). In April 1898, 14,000 fans turned up to watch Spurs play Woolwich Arsenal. The ground was no longer able to cope with the larger crowds and Spurs were forced to move to a new larger site 100 yards down the road, to the current ground in 1899. The White Hart Lane ground was originally a disused nursery owned by the brewery Charringtons and located behind a public house on Tottenham High Road (the actual White Hart Lane road lies a few hundred yards north of the main entrance). The landlord spotted the increased income he could enjoy if Tottenham played their matches behind his pub and in 1899 the club moved in. They brought with them the stand they used at Northumberland Park which gave shelter to 2,500 fans. Notts County were the first visitors to the Lane in a friendly watched by 5,000 people and provided in 115 in receipts; Spurs won 41. QPR became the first competitive visitors to the ground and 11,000 people saw them lose 10 to Tottenham. In 1905 Tottenham raised enough money to buy the freehold to the land and became permanent owners of the ground. As the club grew new stands were added. A new main stand was added in 1909, the East stand was also covered this year and extended further two years later. The profits from the 1921 FA Cup win were used to build a covered terrace at the Paxton Road end and the Park Lane end was built at a cost of over 3,000 some two years later. This increased the grounds capacity to around 58,000 with room for 40,000 under cover. The East Stand (Worcester Avenue) stand was finished in 1934 and this increased capacity to around 80,000 spectators but cost 60,000. The pitch was thoroughly renovated in 1952. This uncovered a number of items from the old nursery on the site and one year later the first floodlights were introduced. The floodlights were upgraded in 1957 which required the cockerel to be moved from the West Stand to the East and then in 1961 floodlight pylons were installed. The West Stand was replaced by an expensive (and way behind schedule) new structure. Various developments and upgrades were implemented over the years. In 1992, following the Taylor Reports recommendation that Premier League clubs eliminate standing areas, the lower terraces of the south and east stand were converted to seating, with the north stand becoming all-seater the following season. The south stand redevelopment was completed in March 1995 and included the first giant Sony Jumbotron TV screen for live game coverage and away match screenings. With this, the capacity of the stadium increased to just over 33,000. In 1997/98 season the Paxton Road stand had a new upper tier added which included the second Jumbotron screen and increased capacity to 36,240 and was funded by a rights issue in 1996.[8] Minor amendments to the seating configuration were made in 2006 bringing the current capacity of the stadium to 36,310. As an initial consideration Spurs were reported to have considered the possibility of the post-games use of the 2012 London Olympic Stadium. But as this proposal would involve a move out of the immediate Tottenham area and because ongoing users were reportedly required to retain the stadiums running track, Spurs dropped the plan in October 2006.[9] But, on 1 October 2010 Tottenham Hotspurs chairman Daniel Levy advised that the club had registered an interest in bidding for the stadium in conjunction with AEG to keep its options open while there remained uncertainties about the success of the Northumberland Development Project.[10] On 12 November 2010 the Olympic Park Legacy Company (OPLC) announced that the Tottenham Hotspur / AEG consortium had been shortlisted as one of the two preferred bidders to take over the Olympic Stadium after the 2012 Olympics.[11] Then the OPLC announced on 11 February 2011 that West Ham had been selected as the preferred bidder for the Olympic Stadium, subject to final governmental ratification.[12] In 2016 Tottenham Hotspur played every home Champions League game in Wembley stadium because of breach of champions league stadium regulations while White Hart Lane was under construction.[10] In 2007 the club stated they were considering options to increase stadium capacity by redevelopment of the current site or a move to a new site. Tottenham Hotspur advised in its 2007/8 Interim Financial Statement that the preferred option would be announced in the first half of 2008, but delayed this decision until the autumn.[13] In October 2008, the club announced that, if approved, they were planning to build a new stadium just to the north of the existing White Hart Lane stadium, with the southern half of the new stadiums pitch located on the northwest corner of the Lane. The unique design of the build would allow the new stadium to be built adjacent to White Hart Lane as the old facility continued to be used. The plan was that during the summer close season when two-thirds of the new stadium was complete, the northern and western stands would be demolished and a new pitch laid. The rest of the stadium would be built in the years to follow.[14] The club submitted a planning application in October 2009. But in May 2010, following adverse reaction, this was withdrawn in favour of a substantially revised planning application. Haringey Council were requested in September 2010 to grant permission for a larger stadium and other associated developments (subject to negotiation of section 106 developer contributions). The Mayor of London gave his approval to the plans to redevelop the stadium on 25 November 2010. On 20 September 2011, planning permission was granted. The opening date for the new stadium has been rescheduled on multiple occasions but is currently being aimed for use for the start of the 2018/19 season.[15] On 7 July 2015, Spurs and the National Football League (NFL) of American football jointly announced that the new stadium would host at least two NFL games each season from 2018 through to 2027.[16] On 25 February 2016, Boris Johnson continued his support for the Northumberland Development Project by granting Tottenham permission to build a new 400 million stadium.[17] The Mayor of London showed support for the project and said the new stadium will create new jobs and boost growth of the area. Since the 1921 FA Cup final the Tottenham Hotspur crest has featured a cockerel. Harry Hotspur (from whom the club is said to have taken its name) wore riding spurs and his fighting cocks were fitted with spurs which can be seen in the crests. In 1909 a former player named William James Scott made a bronze cast of a cockerel standing on a football to be placed on top of the West Stand and since then the cockerel and ball have been the major part of the clubs identity.[18] Between 1956 and 2006 Spurs used a faux heraldic shield featuring a number of local landmarks and associations. The lions flanking the shield came from the Northumberland family (of which Harry Hotspur was a member). The castle is Bruce Castle, 400 yards from the ground and the trees are the Seven Sisters. The arms featured the Latin motto Audere Est Facere (to dare is to do). In 1983, to overcome unauthorised pirate merchandising, the clubs badge was altered by adding the two red heraldic lions and the motto scroll. This device appeared on most Spurs playing kits for the next 23 years. In 2006 to rebrand and modernise the clubs image, the club badge and coat of arms were dumped for a professionally designed logo/emblem.[19] This revamp showed a leaner, fitter cockerel on an old-time football. The club claims that the rebranding kept much of the original meaning of the name, but emphasised its originality.[20] In November 2013, Tottenham forced non-league club Fleet Spurs to change their badge because its new design was too similar to the Tottenham crest.[21] Early crest Crest 19561983 Crest 19832005 Crest 2006 present The first Tottenham kit was navy blue shirt and shorts, but after the first season the club did not have one specific design for many years. In 1884 the club changed to a quartered kit similar in style to that of Blackburn Rovers.[22] Shortly after moving to Northumberland Road, the kit changed again to red shirt and blue shorts. Five years later, after becoming a professional club, they switched to a chocolate and gold striped kit. At the end of the 19th century the club switched colours yet again, to the white shirts and blue shorts which they are now well known for wearing, hence the nickname Lilywhites. This colour choice is thought to be in homage to Preston North End who had recently done The Double. White and navy blue have remained as the clubs basic colours ever since. Soon after the First World War, the cockerel badge was added to the shirt. In 1939 numbers first appeared on shirt backs, and in 1983 Holsten became the first commercial sponsor logo to appear on the shirt. The club were the first to wear long-cut shorts, an innovation at a time where football kits all featured shorts cut well above the knee.[23] When Thomson was chosen as kit sponsor in 2002 some Tottenham fans were unhappy as the shirt-front logo was red, the colour of their closest rivals, Arsenal.[24] In 2006, Tottenham then succeeded in securing a record 34million sponsorship deal with internet casino group Mansion.com.[25] In July 2010 Spurs announced a two-year shirt sponsorship contract with software infrastructure company Autonomy. It was said to be worth 20million.[26] A month later they unveiled a deal with leading specialist bank and asset management firm Investec as shirt sponsor for the Champions League and domestic cup competitions for the next two years. The deal was worth 5million.[27][28] In March 2011, Under Armour announced a five-year deal to supply Spurs with shirts and other apparel from the start of 201213, but other deal terms were undisclosed. The kit was revealed on 12 July in London[29] and two weeks later the third kit was revealed via the promotion of Electronic Arts FIFA 13 video game. 1 Only appeared in the Premier League. Investec Bank appeared in the Champions League, FA Cup, League Cup and Europa League.[28][33] 2 Aurasma is a subsidiary of the Autonomy Corporation. 3 Hewlett-Packard is the parent company of the Autonomy Corporation and only appeared in the Premier League. AIA appeared in the FA Cup, League Cup and Europa League.[34] Between 2001 and 2011 shares in Tottenham Hotspur F.C. were listed on the Alternative Investment Market (AIM index). The majority shareholder was ENIC International Ltd, an investment company established by the British billionaire Joe Lewis. Daniel Levy, Lewiss partner at ENIC, is Executive Chairman of the club. Shareholding by ENIC was increased over this period through the purchase of the remaining 14.7 holding of former chairman Alan Sugar[35] and, in 2009, the 9.9 stake belonging to Stelios Haji-Ioannou through Hodram Inc. On 21 August 2009 the club reported that they had issued a further 30 million shares to fund the initial development costs of the new stadium project, and that 27.8million of these new shares had been purchased by ENIC.[36] The Annual Report for 2010 indicated that ENIC had acquired 76 of all Ordinary Shares and also held 97 of all convertible redeemable preference shares, equivalent to a holding of 85 of share capital.[37] Following an announcement at the 2011 AGM, in January 2012 the club confirmed that they had been transferred into the private ownership of ENIC.[38] In April 2014 the Club reported net profits of 1.5m for the financial year ending June 2013.[39] Tottenham have a large fanbase in the United Kingdom, drawn largely from north London and the Home counties. Five times between 1946 and 1969, Tottenham had the highest average attendance in England.[40][41] There are also Tottenham supporters clubs located all over the world. Tottenham were 9th in average attendances for the 200809 Premier League season, and 11th for all Premier League seasons.[42] Historical supporters of the club have included such figures as A.J. Ayer.[43][44] Tottenham supporters have rivalries with several clubs, mainly within the London area. The fiercest of these is with north London rivals Arsenal. They also share notable rivalries with fellow London clubs Chelsea and West Ham United.[45] The club, as with many clubs in London, has a large Jewish following and this has led to much antisemitic provocation[46][47] against Tottenham supporters. Tottenham supporters, Jewish and non-Jewish, united against this and adopted the nickname Yids, developing chants to support this. Some fans view adopting Yid as a badge of pride, helping defuse its power as an insult.[48] Today it is mainly used to distinguish Tottenham fans from other football supporters. Others, however, disagree with the use of the phrase Yid Army, and believe - even if intended endearingly - that use of the word legitimis[es] references to Jews in football when, frankly, religion, ethnicity or colour should have no place in sport.[49] In April 2011, Jewish comedian, author and Chelsea supporter[50] David Baddiel produced a short film stating that the anti-semitic chanting is as unacceptable as the abuse still suffered by black footballers, and must be stamped out accordingly.[51] After Spurs completed the Double in 196061, the club entered the European Cup for the first time. Their first opponents were Grnik Zabrze the Polish champions and after a hard-fought match Spurs suffered a 42 reverse. Tottenhams tough-tackling prompted the Polish press to describe them as they were no angels. These comments incensed a group of three fans and for the return match at White Hart Lane they dressed as angels wearing white sheets fashioned into togas, sandals, false beards and carrying placards bearing biblical-type slogans. The angels were allowed on the perimeter of the pitch and their fervour whipped up the home fans who responded with a rendition of Glory Glory Hallelujah, which is still sung on terraces at White Hart Lane and other football grounds.[52] The Lilywhites also responded to the atmosphere to win the tie 81. Manager of Spurs, Bill Nicholson, wrote in his autobiography: A new sound was heard in English football in the 19612 season. It was the hymn Glory, Glory Hallelujah being sung by 60,000 fans at White Hart Lane in our European Cup matches. I dont know how it started or who started it, but it took over the ground like a religious feeling. The club through its Community Programme has, since 2006, been working with Haringey Council and the Metropolitan Housing Trust and the local community on developing sports facilities and social programmes which have also been financially supported by Barclays Spaces for Sport and the Football Foundation.[54][55] The Tottenham Hotspur Foundation received high-level political support from the prime minister when it was launched at 10 Downing Street in February 2007.[56] In March 2007 the Club announced a partnership with the charity SOS Childrens Villages UK.[57] Player fines will go towards this charitys childrens village in Rustenburg, South Africa with the funds being used to cover the running costs as well as in support of a variety of community development projects in and around Rustenburg. In the financial year 200607, Tottenham topped a league of Premier League charitable donations when viewed both in overall terms[58] and as a percentage of turnover by giving 4,545,889, including a one-off contribution of 4.5million over four years, to set up the Tottenham Hotspur Foundation.[59] This compared to donations of 9,763 in 200506.[60] This commitment is an example of professional sport supporting the communities and people who support and enrich them through their attendance and other participation and support.[61][62] The football club is one of the highest profile participants in the 10:10 project which encourages individuals, businesses and organisations to take action on environmental issues. They joined in 2009 in a commitment to reducing their carbon footprint. To do this they upgraded their lights to more efficient models, they turned down their heating dials and took less short-haul flights among a host of other things.[63] After working with 10:10 for one year, they reported that they had reduced their carbon emissions by an impressive 14.[63] In contrast, they have successfully sought the reduction of section 106 planning obligations connected to the redevelopment of the stadium. Initially the development would incorporate 50 affordable housing (100 out of 200), but this was reduced to 0 out of 285[64] when Spurs suggested that the development was not financially viable with this obligation. In addition, a payment of 16m for community infrastructure was reduced to 0.5m. This is controversial in an area which has suffered high levels of deprivation as well as long-term planning blight as Spurs bought up property for the development, leaving it empty. Tottenhams ladies team was founded in 1985 as Broxbourne Ladies. They started using the Tottenham Hotspur name for the 199192 season and played in the London and South East Womens Regional Football League (then fourth tier of the game). They won promotion after topping the league in 200708, and currently play in the FA Womens Premier League Southern Division (the third tier of the game). League competitions Cup competitions Steve Perryman holds the appearance record for Spurs, having played 854 games for the club between 1969 and 1986, of which 655 were league matches.[75][76] Jimmy Greaves holds the club goal scoring record with 266 goals in 380 league, cup and European appearances.[77] Tottenhams record league win is 90 against Bristol Rovers in the Second Division on 22 October 1977.[78][79] The clubs record cup victory came on 3 February 1960 with a 132 win over Crewe Alexandra in the FA Cup.[80] Spurs biggest top-flight victory came against Wigan Athletic on 22 November 2009, when they won 91 with Jermain Defoe scoring five goals.[79][81] The clubs record defeat is an 80 loss to 1. FC Kln in the Intertoto Cup on 22 July 1995.[82] Note: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules. Players may hold more than one non-FIFA nationality.

England, which plays in the Premier League, the top tier of English football. Their home ground since 2001 has been St Marys Stadium, before which they were based at The Dell. The club has been nicknamed The Saints since its inception in 1885 due to its history as a church football team, founded as St. Marys Church of England Young Mens Association, and play in red and white shirts. Southampton has a long-standing rivalry with Portsmouth due to its close proximity and both cities respective maritime history. Matches between the two sides are known as the South Coast derby. The club has won the FA Cup once, in 1976, and their highest-ever league finish was second in the First Division in 198384.[4] Southampton were relegated from the Premier League on 15 May 2005, ending 27 successive seasons of top-division football for the club.[5] They returned after a seven-year absence, and have played there ever since.   Southampton were founded at St. Marys Church, on 21 November 1885 by members of the St. Marys Church of England Young Mens Association. St. Marys Y.M.A., as they were usually referred to in the local press, played most of their early games on The Common where games were frequently interrupted by pedestrians insistent on exercising their right to roam. More important matches, such as cup games, were played either at the County Cricket Ground in Northlands Road or the Antelope Cricket Ground in St Marys Road. The club was originally known as St. Marys Young Mens Association F.C. (usually abbreviated to St. Marys Y.M.A.) and then became simply St. Marys F.C. in 188788, before adopting the name Southampton St. Marys when the club joined the Southern League in 1894. For the start of their League career, Saints signed several new players on professional contracts, including Charles Baker, Alf Littlehales and Lachie Thomson from Stoke and Fred Hollands from Millwall.[6] After winning the Southern League title in 189697, the club became a limited company and was renamed Southampton F.C. Southampton won the Southern League championship for three years running between 1897 and 1899 and again in 1901, 1903 and 1904. During this time, they moved to a newly built 10,000 stadium called The Dell, to the northwest of the city centre in 1898. Although they would spend the next 103 years there, the future was far from certain in those early days and the club had to rent the premises first before they could stump up the cash to buy the stadium in the early part of the 20th century. The club reached the first of their four FA Cup Finals in 1900. On that day, they went down 40 to Bury and two years later they would suffer a similar fate at the hands of Sheffield United as they were beaten 21 in a replay of the 1902 final. After World War I, Saints joined the newly formed Football League Third Division in 1920 which split into South and North sections a year later. The 192122 season ended in triumph with promotion and marked the beginning of a 31-year stay in the Second Division. The 192223 season was a unique Even Season  14 wins, 14 draws and 14 defeats for a total of 42 points, or one point per game. Goals for and against statistics were also equal and the team finished in mid-table. In 1925 and 1927, they reached the semi-finals of the FA Cup, losing 20 and 21 to Sheffield United and Arsenal respectively. Saints were briefly forced to switch home matches to the ground of their local rivals Portsmouth at Fratton Park during World War II when a bomb landed on The Dell pitch in November 1940, leaving an 18-foot crater which damaged an underground culvert and flooded the pitch. Promotion was narrowly missed in 194748 when they finished in third place, a feat repeated the following season (despite having an eight-point lead with eight games to play) whilst in 194950 they were to be denied promotion by 0.06 of a goal, missing out on second place to Sheffield United. In the 194849 and 194950 seasons, Charlie Wayman rattled in a total of 56 goals. Then relegation in 1953 sent Saints sliding back into Division 3 (South). It took until 1960 for Saints to regain Second Division status with Derek Reeves plundering 39 of the champions 106 league goals. On 27 April 1963 a crowd of 68,000 at Villa Park saw them lose 10 to Manchester United in the FA Cup semi-final. In 1966, when Ted Bates team were promoted to the First Division as runners-up, with Martin Chivers scoring 30 of Saints 85 league goals. For the following campaign Ron Davies arrived to score 43 goals in his first season. Saints stayed among the elite for eight years, with the highest finishing position being seventh place in 196869 and again in 197071. These finishes were high enough for them to qualify for the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup in 196970 (going out in Round 3 to Newcastle United) and its successor, the UEFA Cup in 197172, when they went out in the first round to Athletic Bilbao. In December 1973, Bates stood down to be replaced by his assistant Lawrie McMenemy. The Saints were one of the first victims of the new three-down relegation system in 1974. Under McMenemys management, Saints started to rebuild in the Second Division, capturing players such as Peter Osgood, Jim McCalliog, Jim Steele and Peter Rodrigues (captain) and in 1976, Southampton reached the FA Cup Final, playing Manchester United at Wembley, and beat much-fancied United 10 with a goal from Bobby Stokes. The following season, they played in Europe again in the Cup Winners Cup, reaching Round 3 where they lost 23 on aggregate to Anderlecht. In 197778, captained by Alan Ball, Saints finished runners-up in the Second Division (behind Bolton Wanderers) and returned to the First Division. They finished comfortably in 14th place in their first season back in the top flight. The following season they returned to Wembley in the final of the League Cup where they acquitted themselves well, losing 32 to Nottingham Forest. In 1980, McMenemy made his biggest signing, capturing the European Footballer of the Year Kevin Keegan. Although Keegans Southampton career only lasted two years, Saints fielded an attractive side also containing Alan Ball, prolific goal-scorer Ted MacDougall, (who still holds the record for the largest number of goals in an FA Cup game nine for Bournemouth against Margate in an 110 win), MacDougalls strike partner at Bournemouth and Norwich City Phil Boyer, club stalwart Mick Channon and Charlie George and in 198081 they scored 76 goals, finishing in sixth place, then their highest league finish. The following season, Kevin Keegan helped lift the club to the top of the First Division. Southampton led the league for over two months, taking top spot on 30 January 1982 and staying there (apart from one week) until 3 April 1982. But in a disappointing end to the season, in which Keegan was hampered by a back injury, Southampton won only two of their last nine games and finished seventh. The winners of a wide-open title race were Keegans old club Liverpool, who were crowned champions on the final day of the season. Keegan scored 26 of Southamptons 72 goals that season, but was then sold to Newcastle. Southampton continued to progress under McMenemys stewardship, and with a team containing Peter Shilton (the England goalkeeper), Nick Holmes, David Armstrong, striker Steve Moran and quick winger Danny Wallace reached their highest ever league finish as runners-up in 198384[4] (three points behind the champions Liverpool) as well as reaching the semi-final of the FA Cup losing 10 to Everton at Highbury Stadium. McMenemy then added experienced midfielder Jimmy Case to his ranks. They finished fifth the following year, but as a result of the Heysel Disaster all English clubs were banned from European competition: had it not been for this, then Southampton would have again qualified for the UEFA Cup. McMenemy left at the end of the 198485 season to be succeeded by Chris Nicholl, who was sacked after six years in charge despite preserving the clubs top flight status. He was replaced by Ian Branfoot, who until the end of the 199091 season had been assistant manager to Steve Coppell at Crystal Palace. By this stage, a key player in the Southampton line-up was Guernsey-born attacking midfielder/striker Matthew Le Tissier, who broke into the first team in the 198687 season. He was voted PFA Young Player of the Year in 1990 and later made eight appearances for the England team he finally retired in 2002 at the age of 33. Another exciting young player to break into the Southampton team just after Le Tissier was Alan Shearer, who at the age of 17 scored a hat-trick against Arsenal in a league match in April 1988. Shearer was a first team regular by 1990, and stayed with Southampton until July 1992, when he was sold to Blackburn Rovers for a national record of more than 3 million. He then became the most expensive footballer in the world when Blackburn sold him to Newcastle for 15 million in 1996. He also scored 30 times for England internationally. Southampton were founding members of the Premier League in 199293, but spent most of the next ten seasons struggling against relegation. In 199596, Southampton finished 17th with 38 league points, avoiding relegation on goal difference. Two important wins during the final weeks of the season did much to ensure that Saints and not Manchester City would achieve Premiership survival. First came a 31 home win over eventual double winners Manchester United, then came a 10 away win over relegated Bolton Wanderers. Former Liverpool and Rangers manager Graeme Souness, was brought in, signing foreign players such as Egil stenstad and Eyal Berkovic. The highlight of the season was a 63 win over Manchester United at The Dell in October, when both his signings scored twice. However, he had to deal with criticism over the Ali Dia debacle. He resigned after just one season in charge, being replaced by Dave Jones who had won promotion to Division One with Stockport County as well as reaching the League Cup semi-finals. In 199899, they were rooted to the bottom of the table for much of the first half of the season but again avoided relegation on the last day of the season after a late run of good results, helped by the intervention of Latvian Marian Pahars and old hero Le Tissier (The so-called Great Escape). In 1999, Southampton were given the go-ahead to build a new 32,000-seat stadium in the St Marys area of the city, having been playing in the Dell since 1898. The stadium had been converted to an all-seater format earlier in the decade, but had a capacity of less than 16,000 and was unsuitable for further expansion. During the 19992000 season, Dave Jones quit as Southampton manager to concentrate on a court case after he was accused of abusing children at the childrens home where he had worked during the 1980s. The accusations were later proved to be groundless, but it was too late to save Jones career as Southampton manager and he was succeeded by ex-England manager Glenn Hoddle. Hoddle helped keep Southampton well clear of the Premier League drop zone but having received an offer he moved to Tottenham Hotspur just before the end of the 200001 season. He was replaced by first-team coach Stuart Gray, who oversaw the relocation to the St Marys Stadium for the 200102 season. At the end of the 200001 season, in the last competitive match at The Dell, Matthew Le Tissier came on late to score the last ever league goal at the old stadium with a half volley on the turn in a 32 win against Arsenal. Gray was sacked after a poor start to the following season, and he was replaced by ex-Coventry City manager Gordon Strachan, who steered Southampton to safety and a secure 11th-place finish. In 200203, Southampton finished eighth in the league and finished runners-up in the FA Cup to Arsenal (after losing 10 at the Millennium Stadium), thanks in no small part to the metamorphosis of James Beattie, who fired home 24 goals, 23 in the league. Strachan resigned in March 2004 and within eight months, two different managers  Paul Sturrock and Steve Wigley  had come and gone. Chairman Rupert Lowe risked the ire of Saints fans when he appointed Harry Redknapp as manager on 8 December 2004, just after his resignation at South Coast rivals Portsmouth.[7] He brought in a number of new signings, including his son Jamie in the attempt to survive relegation. Southampton were relegated from the Premier League on the last day of the season, ending 27 successive seasons of top flight football for the club. Their relegation was ironically confirmed by a 21 home defeat to Manchester United, who had been on the receiving end of many upsets by Southampton over the years, namely in the 1976 FA Cup final and since then on a number of occasions in the league, as well as inflicting a heavy defeat on them in a November 1986 League Cup tie which cost United manager Ron Atkinson his job.[5] Lowe and Southampton continued to make headlines after former England Rugby World Cup-winning coach Sir Clive Woodward joined the clubeventually being appointed technical director in June 2005.[8] In November 2005, early in the clubs first season in the Football League Championship, manager Harry Redknapp resigned to rejoin Portsmouth. After a brief period of caretaker management George Burley was appointed to the post of Head Coach to work alongside Sir Clive Woodward, who was appointed Director of Football. At one point during the 2005/06 season Southampton were in danger of a second successive relegation, but their form improved during the final weeks of the season for the team to finish in a secure 12th place. Rupert Lowe resigned as Chairman in June 2006. There were changes to the membership of the Board and the new Chairman was Jersey-based businessman Michael Wilde, who had become the clubs major shareholder. On the pitch, the good form which secured Southamptons Championship status in 200506 was carried through to the start of the 2006/07 season. The new Board had spent a club record 6million on transfers, and Polish strikers Grzegorz Rasiak and Marek Saganowski and 17-year-old left back Gareth Bale all performed well. Southampton finished in sixth place, the last play-off position. They lost the two-leg play-off semi-final to Derby County on penalties at the end of the second leg. During the 2006/07 season there were indications that there were financial difficulties, with the Board seeking to secure new investment in the club. In February 2007 Michael Wilde stepped down as Chairman to be replaced by local businessman Leon Crouch as Acting Chairman. Crouch retained that role until 21 July 2007. In the 2007/08 season George Burley revealed that players such as Gareth Bale and Kenwyne Jones had to be sold to stop the club going into administration, and that failing to achieve promotion had put the club in serious financial difficulty. Burley left the club in January 2008 to take over as Scotland manager. After another short period of caretaker management, Southampton appointed Nigel Pearson as manager in February 2008. Under Pearsons management, Southampton narrowly avoided relegation by beating Sheffield United 32 on the final day of the season. In July 2008 all the Board members except one resigned, allowing Rupert Lowe and Michael Wilde to return: Wilde as Chairman of Southampton FC and Rupert Lowe as Chairman of Southampton Leisure Holdings plc. Under their leadership the club entered 2008/09, its third season in the Championship. Although Pearson kept the team up, the Board did not renew his contract due to financial constraints. Under Michael Wilde and Rupert Lowe the new Board brought in the relatively unknown Dutchman Jan Poortvliet as Manager. The Clubs financial troubles continued to mount, resulting in more players being sold or loaned out to lower the wage bill and parts of St Marys were closed off to reduce costs. In January 2009 Poortvliet resigned with the club one place from bottom in the Championship, with Mark Wotte taking over managerial duties.[9][10][11] In April 2009 Southamptons parent company was placed in administration. A ten-point penalty was imposed, but as the team was already being relegated due to finishing one place from bottom of the Football League Championship this points deduction had to apply to the 2009/10 season. By the end of May 2009 the club was unable to meet its staff wages commitments and asked employees to work unpaid as a gesture of goodwill. The administrator, Mark Fry, warned that the club now faced imminent bankruptcy unless a buyer was found.[12] The following day the Matt Le Tissier-backed Pinnacle consortium paid a non-refundable fee of 500,000 to gain exclusivity for 21 days, which meant that the employees at the club could be paid.[13] That period of exclusivity lapsed on 19 June without a deal being completed, because the Football League refused to give the necessary approval of the proposed take-over unless Pinnacle waived any right to appeal against the ten-point deduction. The decision was confirmed by a meeting of the Football League Board on 21 June.[14] In June 2009 administrator Mark Fry confirmed negotiations with two groups of investors, but no group had an exclusivity deal and potential buyers would need to move straight away to purchase the club.[15] This was followed by a statement from the Pinnacle group that they would accept the ten-point penalty enforced by the Football League in order that the takeover of the club might be completed but subsequently it was reported that the Le Tissier-backed Pinnacle Consortium had withdrawn their offer for the club. At this point it was announced that a mystery overseas consortium were close to a deal. In July 2009 the administrators confirmed that the club had been sold to a buyer owned and controlled by Markus Liebherr.[16] On 9 July 2009 Mark Wotte was sacked as head coach. On 17 July 2009 the club confirmed the appointment of Alan Pardew as the new First Team Manager.[17] The Saints made their first big signing under Liebherr, striker Rickie Lambert, who was purchased on 10 August from fellow League One side Bristol Rovers.[18] Liebherr also brought in Italian businessman Nicola Cortese to look after the clubs business interests on his behalf. Southampton started the 2009/10 season in the third tier of English football for the first time in 50 years with 10 points. This was within six years of being FA Cup runners-up, UEFA Cup participants and the eighth placed team in the Premier League. The points deduction meant the team started the season in bottom place, but under Pardews management and with new players they gradually climbed the table through the season. In March 2010 Southampton won their first trophy since 1976 when they defeated Carlisle United 41 at Wembley to claim the Football League Trophy.[19] Southampton finished the season in 7th place, seven points from the last play-off position. A new home shirt was unveiled on 10 June 2010 in celebration of the clubs 125th anniversary. The design was based on the original St Marys Y.M.A. kit used in 1885; it featured the new anniversary crest and was without a sponsors logo.[20] The away kit was released a short time later. This kit had a black shirt, black shorts (both with red trim) and red socks (with black trim). As with the home kit the away kit included the new crest and had no main shirt sponsor. It was announced on 11 August 2010 that Markus Liebherr had died; the clubs future had however been assured and planned for before his death.[21] [22] On 30 August 2010 Alan Pardew was sacked as First Team Manager. Dean Wilkins was installed as Caretaker Manager for a three-game period while the club started its search for a new Manager. On 12 September Nigel Adkins was announced as Southamptons new Manager, joining from Scunthorpe United.[23] Southampton achieved promotion to the Championship on 7 May 2011 with a 31 victory over Walsall. Returning to the Championship Southampton made a strong start to the season, winning their first four league games for the first time in their history (this also established a club record of ten consecutive league victories following a successful spell at the end of the previous League One season). Southampton soon secured their best start to a season for 75 years when they beat Nottingham Forest 32 at home, then beat Birmingham City 41 at home to go top of the league and extend their winning run at St Marys to 13 league games, setting a new club record. On 13 April Southampton lost 31 at home to fellow promotion challengers Reading in a match which effectively decided the Championship title. This was the Saints first home defeat in the league since mid-January. The team however confirmed promotion to the Premier League with a 40 defeat of relegated Coventry, with goals from Adam Lallana, Billy Sharp, Jos Hooiveld and Jos Fonte. The game set a record attendance at St Marys Stadium with 32,363 fans. Rickie Lambert finished the season as the Championships top goalscorer with 27 league goals, his third Golden Boot in four seasons. He also won the Championship Player of the Year award. Southampton returned to the Premier league for season 201213 initially under manager, Nigel Adkins. Substantial sums were spent to strengthen the playing squad with a clutch of eight new signings for the team before the transfer window closed. Early in the season, Adkins was sacked and replaced by Argentine coach Mauricio Pochettino.[24][25] After his arrival, Southampton recorded some impressive results, with home wins against Manchester City, Liverpool and Chelsea. Southampton finished the season in 14th place, four places above the relegation zone, with 41 points. The club was active again in the transfer market in preparation for next season. Southampton improved on their position in the final league table, ending the season in eighth place, with 56 points. Pochettino departed the club in the close season for Premier League rivals Tottenham. The club subsequently appointed Ronald Koeman as his replacement on 16 June 2014, signing a three-year deal. At the end of the 201314 season, Southampton made a number of high-profile sales  including Rickie Lambert, captain Adam Lallana and Lovren all joining Liverpool for estimated fees of 4 million, 25 million and 20 million respectively,[26][27][28] left-back Luke Shaw to Manchester United for a club record fee in the region of 27 million,[29] and right-back Calum Chambers joined Arsenal for approximately 16 million.[30] The club replaced the departing players with a number of signings including the Serbian midfielder Duan Tadi, from Dutch side Twente,[31] and Italian striker Graziano Pell from Feyenoord.[32] Chelsea left-back Ryan Bertrand was also recruited, initially on a season-long which was eventually converted to a full purchase. Other players brought in were goalkeeper, Fraser Forster, for 10 million from Celtic, Romanian defender Florin Gardo from Steaua Bucureti, and Irish striker Shane Long from Hull City. Southampton also signed Senegalese winger Sadio Man from Red Bull Salzburg for 10 million and Belgium defender Toby Alderweireld on a season-long loan from Atltico Madrid.[33] The club earned several new accolades in the 201415 season: A record 80 victory over Sunderland in October 2014, and their first league victory since 1988 at Old Trafford against Manchester United in January 2015, after Duan Tadi scored the only goal of the game. In their final home game of the season, a 61 victory against Aston Villa, Sadio Man scored three goals in the space of 176 seconds, making it the fastest hat trick in the history of the Premier League.[34] The club finished seventh, their highest ever Premier League rank, with 60 points.[35][36][36] The club qualified for the 201516 UEFA Europa League following Aston Villas 40 defeat to Arsenal in the 2015 FA Cup Final, as Arsenal had already secured a place in the UEFA Champions League.[37] Despite securing 30 and 20 victories home and away respectively against Vitesse in the Europa League, the club failed to make it past the playoff stage after a 11 draw and 10 loss home and away respectively to Midtjylland, which resulted in 21 goal aggregate and consequential elimination.[38] Over the next transfer window, Southampton sold Nathaniel Clyne to Liverpool for an estimated 12.5 million[39] and Morgan Schneiderlin to Manchester United for an estimated 27 million.[40] The club signed Dutch centre back Virgil van Dijk for an estimated 13 million from Celtic, as well as right back Cuco Martina and Spanish defensive midfielder Oriol Romeu. Steven Caulker and Maarten Stekelenburg were signed on loan from Queens Park Rangers and Fulham, respectively. On 2 December 2015, the club endured their biggest defeat in three years after losing 61 to Liverpool at home in the quarter-finals of the League Cup.[41] Fraser Forster, who had been absent since March 2015 due to injury, returned to the main squad in a home game against Watford on 13 January 2016, which ended in a 20 victory.[42] The club later signed striker Charlie Austin for 4 million, who debuted in an away game against Manchester United, scoring the only goal of the game at the 87 minute mark to secure Southampton a back-to-back league victory at Old Trafford, a feat last achieved in 1969.[43] Southampton also made headlines following a 32 victory over Liverpool at St. Marys on 20 March 2016, despite Liverpool leading 20 after just 22 minutes and with Southampton scoring all three goals in the final 30 minutes.[44] Southampton once again set new records for the club at the end of the season, finishing in sixth place, their highest yet, with 63 points. They once again qualified for the Europa League, although this time immediately entered the group stages, as opposed to the playoff rounds. On 14 June 2016, manager Ronald Koeman left Southampton to join Everton. On 23 June, Victor Wanyama left to join Tottenham for a fee believed to be around 12 million and on 28 June, Sadio Man left to join Liverpool for a fee of around 34 million but which could rise to 38 million with add-ons. On 25 June, Southampton announced the signing of Nathan Redmond from Norwich for approximately 10 million, while on 30 June, the club appointed Claude Puel as its new manager on a three-year contract. Eric Black was named his assistant manager and Pascal Plancque his assistant first team coach. On 11 July, Graziano Pell left to join Shandong Luneng for an estimated fee of 13 million and on the same day Southampton signed Pierre-Emile Hjbjerg from Bayern Mnchen for 12.8 million. Off the pitch, in December 2016, Southampton became implicated in the United Kingdom football sexual abuse scandal after former players Dean Radford and Jamie Webb told the BBC about incidents they said happened when they were in their teens.[45] Four, later six, players alleged abuse by an ex-Southampton employee, Bob Higgins, who was still working in football[46] at non-league Fleet Town.[47][48] Note: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules.

Southampton runs a highly successful youth academy,[50][51] with a number of teams from ages nine to 18 years. Recent products of the clubs youth system include England internationals Adam Lallana, Theo Walcott, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Wayne Bridge and Luke Shaw, Wales winger Gareth Bale and Northern Ireland defender Chris Baird.

Against Wolverhampton Wanderers, 6 August 2005[52] Highest transfer fees [55] St Marys Stadium has been home to the Saints since August 2001. It has a capacity of 32,689[56] and is one of only a handful of stadia in Europe to meet UEFAs Four Star criteria.[57] The stadium has also been host to a number of international games. The grounds record attendance is 32,363, set in a game between Southampton and Coventry City in April 2012.[58] From 1898 to 2001 Southampton played their home games at The Dell. The purpose-built stadium was redeveloped a number of times through its 103-year history, with two of the stands being completely rebuilt after fires and in 1950 it became the first ground in England to have permanent floodlighting installed. Following the Taylor report The Dell was converted to an all-seated stadium and, with a capacity of approximately 15,000, became the smallest ground in Englands top flight, precipitating a move to a new home. Prior to The Dell the clubs home grounds were the Antelope Ground, from 1887 to 1896, and the County Cricket Ground, from 1896 to 1898.[59] The clubs training facilities, Staplewood, are located in Marchwood on the edge of the New Forest. The current facilities were opened in November 2014, at a cost of almost 40m.[citation needed] The main building was named after the clubs late owner, Markus Liebherr.[60] For the 201213 season, and for the foreseeable future, the club agreed a deal with Eastleigh F.C., currently of the Conference South, for the use of their stadium, Ten Acres, for The Saints U21 team fixtures. This continues a partnership with Eastleigh that has lasted for the last decade.[61] The Saints anthem is the popular sport tune When the Saints Go Marching In, and since the clubs official nickname is the Saints, they are one of only a few teams who do not change the original lyric. Originally, the club used the same crest as the one used by the city itself. However, during the 1970s a competition was run for fans to design a new one. The winning design, designed by Rolland Parris, was used for around 20 years, before being modified slightly by Southampton design agency The Graphics Workshop in the 1990s for copyright reasons. From top-to-bottom, the halo is a reference to the nickname Saints, the ball to the nature of the club, the scarf to the fans and the team colours. The tree represents the nearby New Forest and Southampton Common, with the water representing Southamptons connections with the rivers, seas and oceans. Below that is a white rose the symbol of the city which is also present on the city crest.[62] In the mid-1990s the ball was changed from a vintage style ball (such as those used in the 1960s) to the current ball with black and white panels, for copyright reasons. On 13 May 2010, the official crest for the 125th year anniversary was released: The black outline and halo feature will now appear in gold, whilst the all important years 1885 and 2010 are scripted either side of the shield, with the figure 125 replacing the ball. The badge was used on Southamptons shirts for the 201011 season.[63] The South Coast Derby is the name given to matches between the Saints and their fierce nearby rivals, Portsmouth F.C., from the city of the same name just over 18 miles from Southampton. The matches are also referred to as the Hampshire Derby. Including Southern League games, there have been 70 games between the clubs, with Southampton winning 34 and Portsmouth 21. Ten companies have sponsored the club, thus appearing on the players shirts, over the course of its history. The first company to do so was photocopier manufacturer Rank Xerox who sponsored the club for three years from 1980. Air Florida briefly sponsored Southampton in 1983 before Draper Tools, who have a large factory in nearby Eastleigh sponsored the club for nine years between 1984 and 1993. Millbrook based company Dimplex, who produce electrical goods such as heaters were the next brand name to appear on the clubs shirts and merchandise. They began sponsoring in 1993 before the deal ended in 1995. The Sanderson Group PLC took up the mantle, for four years from 1995, also sponsoring Sheffield Wednesday at the same time. Investment company Friends Provident were the final sponsors of the clubs time at The Dell. Their deal began in 1999 and was renewed shortly before the naming of St. Marys Stadium, to which they also bought the naming rights. However they chose not to renew either deal in 2006, after which budget airline Flybe.com stepped in. Flybe.com was shortly followed by aap3, a business that specializes in IT engineering. On 9 May 2014, Southampton announced a two-year deal with local based global consumer electronics firm Veho to become the main club sponsor from 1 July 2014.[64] On 8 June 2016, with Vehos sponsorship contract expired, Virgin Media were announced as the new club sponsors after signing a three-year deal.[65] [52][66] Longest winning run Longest unbeaten run Longest home winning streak Biggest wins Biggest losses Highest scoring Football League game Record home attendance 32,363 against Coventry City, 28 April 2012

East London, England. They compete in the Premier League, the top tier of English football. In 2016 the club re-located to the London Stadium. The club was founded in 1895 as Thames Ironworks and reformed in 1900 as West Ham United. They moved to the Boleyn Ground in 1904, which remained their home ground for more than a century. The team initially competed in the Southern League and Western League before joining the Football League in 1919. They were promoted to the top flight in 1923, when they were also losing finalists in the first FA Cup Final held at Wembley. In 1940, the club won the inaugural Football League War Cup. West Ham have been winners of the FA Cup three times, in 1964, 1975, and 1980, and have also been runners-up twice, in 1923, and 2006. The club have reached two major European finals, winning the European Cup Winners Cup in 1965 and finishing runners-up in the same competition in 1976. West Ham also won the Intertoto Cup in 1999. They are one of eight clubs never to have fallen below the second tier of English football, spending 59 of 91 league seasons in the top flight, up to and including the 201617 season. The clubs highest league position to date came in 198586 when they achieved third place in the then First Division. Three West Ham players were members of the 1966 World Cup final-winning England team: captain Bobby Moore and goalscorers Geoff Hurst and Martin Peters.   The earliest generally accepted incarnation of West Ham United was founded in 1895 as the Thames Ironworks team by foreman and local league referee Dave Taylor and owner Arnold Hills[3] and was announced in the Thames Ironworks Gazette of June 1895. The team played on a strictly amateur basis for 1895 at least, with a team featuring a number of works employees including Thomas Freeman (ships fireman), Walter Parks (clerk), Tom Mundy, Walter Tranter and James Lindsay (all boilermakers), William Chapman, George Sage, and William Chamberlain and apprentice riveter Charlie Dove.[3] The club, Thames Ironworks[5] were the first ever winners of the West Ham Charity Cup in 1895 contested by clubs in the West Ham locality, then won the London League in 1897. They turned professional in 1898 upon entering the Southern League Second Division, and were promoted to the First Division at the first attempt.[6] The following year they came second from bottom, but had established themselves as a fully fledged competitive team. They comfortably fended off the challenge of local rivals Fulham in a relegation play-off, 51 in late April 1900 and retained their First Division status.[6] The team initially played in full dark blue kits, as inspired by Mr. Hills, who had been an Oxford University Blue, but changed the following season by adopting the sky blue shirts and white shorts combination worn through 1897 to 1899. In 1899, they acquired their now-traditional home kit combination of claret shirts and sky blue sleeves in a wager involving Aston Villa players, who were League Champions at the time.[7][8] Following growing disputes over the running and financing of the club, in June 1900 Thames Ironworks F.C. was disbanded,[5] then almost immediately relaunched on 5 July 1900 as West Ham United F.C. with Syd King[5] as their manager and future manager Charlie Paynter as his assistant. Because of the original works team roots and links (still represented upon the club badge), they are still known as the Irons or the Hammers amongst fans and the media.[5][9][10] West Ham Utd joined the Western League for the 1901 season[11] while also continuing to play in the Southern Division 1. In 1907, West Ham were crowned the Western League Division 1B Champions, and then defeated 1A champions Fulham 10 to become the Western League Overall Champions.[11] The reborn club continued to play their games at the Memorial Grounds in Plaistow (funded by Arnold Hills) but moved to a pitch in the Upton Park area in the guise of the Boleyn Ground stadium in 1904. West Hams first game in their new home was against fierce rivals Millwall[5] (themselves an Ironworks team, albeit for a rival company) drawing a crowd of 10,000 and with West Ham running out 30 winners,[12] and as the Daily Mirror wrote on 2 September 1904, Favoured by the weather turning fine after heavy rains of the morning, West Ham United began their season most auspiciously yesterday evening; when they beat Millwall by 3 goals to 0 on their new enclosure at Upton Park.[citation needed] In 1919, still under Kings leadership, West Ham gained entrance to the Football League Second Division, their first game being a 11 draw with Lincoln City, and were promoted to Division One in 1923, also making it to the first ever FA Cup Final to be held at the old Wembley stadium. Their opponents were Bolton Wanderers. This was also known as the White Horse Final, so named because an estimated 200,000 people came to see the match; spilling out on to the pitch, which had to be cleared prior to kick-off, by Billie, a giant white horse (actually grey) being ridden by PC George Scorey. The Cup Final match itself ended 20 to Bolton. The team enjoyed mixed success in Division 1 but retained their status for ten years and reached the FA Cup semi-final in 1933.[13] In 1932, the club was relegated to Division Two[14] and long term custodian Syd King was sacked after serving the club in the role of manager for 32 years, and as a player from 1899 to 1903. Following relegation, King had mental health problems. He appeared drunk at a board meeting and soon after committed suicide.[15] He was replaced with his assistant manager Charlie Paynter, who himself had been with West Ham in a number of roles since 1897 and who went on to serve the team in this role until 1950 for a total of 480 games. The club spent most of the next 30 years in this division, first under Paynter and then later under the leadership of former player Ted Fenton. Fenton succeeded in getting the club once again promoted to the top level of English football in 1958. With the considerable input of player Malcolm Allison, Fenton helped develop both the initial batch of future West Ham stars and West Hams approach to the game.[16][17][18][19] Ron Greenwood was appointed as Fentons successor in 1961 and soon led the club to two major trophies, winning the FA Cup in 1964. The team was led by the young Bobby Moore.[20] They also won the European Cup Winners Cup.[21][22] During the 1966 FIFA World Cup, key members of the tournament winners England were West Ham players, including the captain, Bobby Moore; Martin Peters (who scored in the final); and Geoff Hurst, who scored the first, and only, hat-trick in a mens World Cup final.[22][23] All three players had come through the youth team at West Ham.[24] There is a Champions statue in Barking Road, opposite The Boleyn Tavern, commemorating West Hams three sons who helped win the 1966 World Cup: Bobby Moore, Geoff Hurst and Martin Peters. Also included on the statue is Evertons Ray Wilson.[25]\nThey also won the FA Cup in 1975 by defeating Fulham 20. The Fulham team had former England captains Alan Mullery and West Ham legend Bobby Moore.[26] After a difficult start to the 197475 season, Greenwood moved himself upstairs to become general manager and, without informing the board, appointed his assistant John Lyall as team manager.[27] The result was instant success  the team scored 20 goals in their first four games combined and won the FA Cup, becoming the last team to win the FA Cup with an all-English side when they beat Fulham 20 in the 1975 final.[28] Lyall then guided West Ham to another European Cup Winners Cup final in 1976, though the team lost the match 42 to Belgian side Anderlecht.[29] Greenwoods tenure as general manager lasted less than three years, as he was appointed to manage England in the wake of Don Revies resignation in 1977.[30] In 1978, West Ham were again relegated to Division Two, but Lyall was retained as manager and led the team to an FA Cup Final win against Arsenal in 1980, their last major honour. They reached the final by defeating Everton in the semi-final.[31] The Hammers won 10, with a goal scored from a header by Trevor Brooking in the 13th minute.[32] This is notable as no team outside the top division has won the trophy since. West Ham were promoted to Division One in 1981, and finished in the top ten of the first division for the next three seasons before achieving their highest-ever league finish of third in 198586; a group of players which came to be known as The Boys of 86. However, they suffered relegation again in 1989, which resulted in Lyalls sacking.[33] He was awarded an ex gratia payment of 100,000 but left the club in what Lyall described as upsetting circumstances, meriting only 73 words in a terse acknowledgement of his service in the club programme. Lyall left West Ham after 34 years service.[34] After Lyall, Lou Macari briefly led the team, though he resigned after less than a single season in order to clear his name of allegations of illegal betting while manager of Swindon Town.[35] He was replaced by former player Billy Bonds.[36] In Bonds first full season, 199091, West Ham again secured promotion to Division One. Now back in the top flight, Bonds saw West Ham through one of their most controversial seasons. With the club planning to introduce a bond scheme, there was crowd unrest. West Ham finished last and were relegated back to Division Two after only one season.[37][38][39][40] However, they rebounded strongly in 199293. With Trevor Morley and Clive Allen scoring 40 goals, they guaranteed themselves second place on the last day of the season with a 20 home win against Cambridge United, and with it promotion to the Premier League.[41][42] With the team in the Premier League, there was a need to rebuild the team. Oxford United player Joey Beauchamp was recruited for a fee of 1.2 million. Shortly after arriving at the club, however, he became unhappy, citing homesickness from his native Oxford as the reason. Bonds in particular found this attitude hard to understand compared to his own committed, never-say-die approach; providing for Bonds further evidence of the decay in the modern game and modern player.[43] Fifty-eight days later, Beauchamp was signed by Swindon Town for a club-record combined fee of 800,000 which included defender Adrian Whitbread going in the opposite direction. Whitbread was valued at 750,000 in the deal.[44] Assistant manager Harry Redknapp was also now taking a bigger role in the transfer of players, with the clubs approval. With rumours of his old club AFC Bournemouth being prepared to offer him a position,[45] the West Ham board and their managing director, Peter Storrie, made a controversial move. The board were anxious not to lose Redknapps services and offered Bonds a place away from the day-to-day affairs of the clubon the West Ham board. This would have allowed them to appoint Redknapp as manager. Bonds refused the post offered and walked away from the club.[46] His accusations of deceit and manipulation by the board and by Redknapp have continued to cause ill-feeling.[46] Peter Storrie claimed they that they had handled the situation correctly, saying, If Harry had gone to Bournemouth, there was a good chance Bill would have resigned anyway, so we were in a no-win situation. Were sad that Bill is going, and its a big blow but its time to move on and we have appointed a great manager.[47] Redknapp became manager on 10 August 1994.[48] Redknapps time at West Ham was notable for the turnover of players during his tenure and for the level of attractive football and success which had not been seen since the managership of John Lyall. Over 134 players passed through the club while he was manager, producing a net transfer fee deficit of 16 million, despite the 18 million sale of Rio Ferdinand to Leeds United.[49] Some were notably successful, such as the signings of Stuart Pearce,[50] Trevor Sinclair,[50] Paolo Di Canio,[50] John Hartson,[50] Eyal Berkovic[50] and Ian Wright.[51] Meanwhile, some were expensive, international players who failed at West Ham, such as Florin Raducioiu;[50] Davor uker, who earned as much in wages as the revenue gained from one entire stand and yet made only eight appearances;[49] Christian Bassila, who cost 720,000 and played only 86 minutes of football;[49] Titi Camara; Gary Charles, whose wages amounted to 4.4 million but made only three starts for the club;[49] Rigobert Song; Paulo Futre;[50] and Marco Boogers,[50] a player often quoted as one of the biggest failures in the Premier League.[52] His first season in charge saw West Ham fighting the threat of relegation until the last few weeks,[53] while his third season would also see another relegation battle. Always willing to enter the transfer market, Redknapp bought in the winter transfer window John Hartson and Paul Kitson who added the impetus needed at the seasons end.[54][55] In 1999, West Ham finished fifth, their highest position in the top flight since 1986.[50] They also won the Intertoto Cup beating French club Metz to qualify for the 19992000 UEFA Cup.[50][56] Things began to falter for Redknapp with the sale for 18 million to Leeds of Rio Ferdinand in November 2000. Redknapp used the transfer money poorly with purchases such as Ragnvald Soma, who cost 800,000 and played only seven league games, Camera and Song. Redknapp felt he needed more funds with which to deal in the transfer market.[57] Chairman Brown lost patience with Redknapp due to his demands for further transfer funds. In June 2001, called to a meeting with Brown expecting to discuss contracts, he was fired.[57] His assistant Frank Lampard left too, making the sale of his son Frank Lampard, Jr., inevitable;[57] in the summer of 2001, he joined Chelsea for million.[58] With several names, such as former player Alan Curbishley, now linked with the job, Chairman Brown recruited from within the club,[57] appointing reserve team coach Glenn Roeder as manager on 9 May 2001.[48] He had already failed in management with Gillingham, where he lost 22 of the 35 games he managed, and Watford.[59] His first big signings were the return of Don Hutchison for 5 million[60] and Czech centre back Tom epka.[61] Finishing seventh in his first season[62] Roeder, in his office at Upton Park, suffered a blocked blood vessel in his brain.[59][63] Now needing medical help and recuperation, former stalwart Trevor Brooking stood in as caretaker manager.[63] Despite not losing another game, the Hammers were relegated on the last day of the season at Birmingham City with a record for a relegated club of 42 points. Ten seasons of top tier football were over.[64] Many top players including Joe Cole, Di Canio and Kanoute all left the club. The next season, now in the second tier, Roeder resumed his stint as manager. Results were still poor, however, and after an away defeat to Rotherham United, he was sacked on 24 August 2003.[59] Brooking again took over as caretaker.[65] He lost only one game, a 20 away defeat to Gillingham[66] and is known as the best manager West Ham never had.[67] Former Crystal Palace player and manager of Reading Alan Pardew was lined up to be the next bench boss. Reading and their chairman, John Madejski, however, were reluctant to let him leave.[68] After serving a period of notice and gardening leave, and with West Ham paying Reading 380,000 in compensation, he was appointed manager on 18 October 2003, their tenth manager.[69] Pardew set out to rebuild the side bringing in Nigel Reo-Coker,[70] Marlon Harewood[71] and Brian Deane.[72] In his first season in charge, they made the playoff final only to lose to Crystal Palace.[73] His signings of Bobby Zamora, Matthew Etherington and veterans Chris Powell and Teddy Sheringham saw West Ham finishing sixth and subsequently beat Preston North End 10 thanks to a Zamora goal in the 2005 playoff final, securing a return to the Premier League.[74] After ensuring promotion, Pardew said, Its a team effort. We defended well and were back where we belong.[75] On their return to the top division, West Ham finished in ninth place,[76] The highlight of the 200506 season, however, was reaching the FA Cup final and taking favourites Liverpool to a penalty shootout after a 33 draw. West Ham lost the shootout, but nonetheless gained entry to the following seasons UEFA Cup as Liverpool had already qualified for the Champions League. In August 2006, West Ham completed a major coup on the last day of the transfer window after completing the signings of Carlos Tevez and Javier Mascherano.[77] The club was eventually bought by an Icelandic consortium, led by Eggert Magnsson, in November 2006.[78] Manager Alan Pardew was sacked after poor form during the season[79] and was replaced by former Charlton Athletic manager Alan Curbishley.[80] The signings of Mascherano and Tevez were investigated by the Premier League, who were concerned that details of the transfers had been omitted from official records. The club was found guilty and fined million in April 2007.[81] However, West Ham avoided a points deduction which ultimately became critical in their avoidance of relegation at the end of the 200607 season. Following on from this event, Wigan Athletic chairman Dave Whelan, supported by other sides facing possible relegation, including Fulham and Sheffield United, threatened legal action.[82] West Ham escaped relegation by winning seven of their last nine games, including a 10 win over Arsenal, and on the last day of the season defeated newly crowned League Champions Manchester United 10 with a goal by Tevez to finish 15th.[83] In the 200708 season, West Ham remained reasonably consistently in the top half of the league table, with Fredrik Ljungberg in the team, despite a slew of injuries; new signing Craig Bellamy missed most of the campaign, while Kieron Dyer was out from August 2007.[84][85] The last game of the season, at the Boleyn Ground, saw West Ham draw 22 against Aston Villa, ensuring a tenth-place finish three points ahead of rivals Tottenham Hotspur. It was a five-place improvement on the previous season, and most importantly West Ham were never under any realistic threat of relegation. After a row with the board over the sale of defenders Anton Ferdinand and George McCartney to Sunderland, manager Alan Curbishley resigned on 3 September 2008.[86] His successor was former Chelsea striker Gianfranco Zola, who took over on 11 September 2008 to become the clubs first non-British manager.[87] In the 200809 season, West Ham finished ninth, a single place improvement. In the 200910 season, West Ham started strongly with a 20 win over newly promoted Wolverhampton Wanderers with goals from Mark Noble and newly appointed captain Matthew Upson.[88] A League Cup match against old rivals Millwall brought about violent riots outside the ground as well as pitch invasions and crowd trouble inside Upton Park.[89][90] In August 2009, the financial concerns of Icelandic owners parent companies left the current owners unable to provide any funds until a new owner was found. The clubs shirt sponsor SBOBET provided the club with help purchase a much needed striker, the Italian Alessandro Diamanti.[91] West Ham had a poor season which involved a prolonged battle against relegation.[92] They finally secured their survival with two games remaining by defeating Wigan 32.[93] The club managed to take 35 points from 38 games, seven fewer than the total they had when relegated seven years prior.[92] On 11 May 2010, two days after the end of the 200910 season, West Ham announced the termination of Zolas contract with immediate effect.[94] On 3 June 2010, Avram Grant signed a four-year deal to become the next manager of West Ham subject to a work permit.[95] West Hams form continued to be poor with the team seldom outside the relegation zone,[96] placing Grants future as manager under serious doubt.[97] A 40 Football League Cup quarter-final win over Manchester United was an otherwise bright spot in a disappointing season.[98] West Hams form in the Premier League did not affect their form in the two domestic cups. The Hammers reached the semi-final of the League Cup before being eliminated by eventual winners Birmingham City as well as the quarter final of the FA cup before a 21 defeat at Stoke City.[99][100] On 15 May 2011, West Hams relegation to the Championship was confirmed after a comeback from Wigan at the DW Stadium. With West Ham leading 02 at half-time through two Demba Ba goals, Wigan battled back to win 32 thanks to an added-time strike from Charles NZogbia. Following the loss, West Ham announced the sacking of manager Avram Grant just one season into his tenure.[101] On 1 June 2011, Sam Allardyce was appointed as manager as Grants replacement.[102] The club finished third in the 201112 Football League Championship with 86 points and took part in the play-offs. They beat Cardiff City in the play off semi-final 50 on aggregate to reach the final against Blackpool at Wembley on 19 May 2012. Carlton Cole opened the scoring, and although Blackpool equalised early in the second half, Ricardo Vaz T scored the winner for West Ham in the 87th minute.[103] West Ham, on their return to the Premier League, signed former players James Colllins and George McCartney on permanent deals, as well as record signing Matt Jarvis and Andy Carroll on loan.[104][105][106][107] They won their first game of the season, on 18 August 2012, 10 against Aston Villa thanks to a Kevin Nolan goal.[108] The highlight of the first half of the season was a 31 home win against reigning European champions Chelsea on 1 December 2012 which saw them in eighth position[109] and 12th at the end of the year.[110] On 22 March 2013, West Ham secured a 99-year lease deal on the Olympic Stadium, with it planned to be used as their home ground from the 201617 season.[111] Tenth place was secured at the end of the season with nine home wins and only three away from home. Only 11 away goals were scored, the lowest of the entire league.[112] In 201314, West Ham finished 13th in the Premier League.[113] They also reached the semi-finals of the League Cup before losing 90 on aggregate to eventual cup-winners Manchester City.[114] A feature of the season were the criticisms of manager Sam Allardyce by supporters relating to his perceived negative playing tactics.[115][116][117] West Ham finished 12th in the 201415 Premier League, one place higher than the previous season. Minutes after the last game of the season, on 24 May 2015, the club announced that Allardyces contract would not be renewed and that they were seeking a new manager.[118] By winning the Premier League Fair Play table for 201415, West Ham qualified for the 201516 UEFA Europa League, entering at the first qualifying round.[119] On 9 June 2015, former West Ham player Slaven Bili was appointed as manager on a three-year contract.[120] In Bilis fourth game in charge, the team won at Anfield for the first time in 52 years, beating Liverpool 03, with goals from Manuel Lanzini, Mark Noble and Diafra Sakho.[121] In Bilis first season as manager, West Ham finished seventh in the Premier League. The team broke several records for the club in the Premier League era, including the highest number of points (62), the highest number of goals in a season (65), the least number of games lost in a season (8) and the lowest number of away defeats (5).[122] Following Manchester Uniteds win in the 2016 FA Cup Final, West Ham took their Europa League place and qualified for the third qualifying round of the 201617 edition.[123] In August 2016, Andr Ayew became the clubs most expensive signing after joining for a fee of 20.5million from Swansea City.[124] The original club crest was a crossed pair of rivet hammers; tools commonly used in the iron and shipbuilding industry. A castle was later (circa 190304) added to the crest and represents a prominent local building, Green Street House, which was known as Boleyn Castle through an association with Anne Boleyn. The manor was reportedly one of the sites at which Henry VIII courted his second queen, though in truth there is no factual evidence other than the tradition of rumour.[125] The castle may have also been added as a result of the contribution made to the club by players of Old Castle Swifts, or even the adoption (in 1904) of Boleyn Castle FC[126] as their reserve side when they took over their grounds on the site. The crest was redesigned and updated by London design agency Springett Associates in the late 1990s, featuring a wider yellow castle with fewer cruciform windows along with the peaked roofs being removed; the tops of the towers had previously made the castle appear more akin to Disneylands Sleeping Beautys Castle than a functioning fortress. The designer also altered other details to give a more substantial feel to the iconography.[127] When the club redesigned the facade of the stadium (construction finished 200102) the castle from the later badge was incorporated into the structure at the main entrance to the ground. A pair of towers were prominent features of the grounds appearance, both bearing the clubs modern insignia (which was also located in the foyer and other strategic locations).[128] A new badge was approved by supporters in July 2014 and was introduced following the end of the 201516 season, when the club moved into the Olympic Stadium.[129] It removes the Boleyn Castle due to the club moving away, leaving just the crossed hammers, which the club says is inspired by the crest during the career of Bobby Moore. The word London will be introduced below to establish the club firmly on the international stage, and the more minimalist approach is to give a strong statement that is instantly West Ham United. The shape of the crest is that of the hull of HMSWarrior, the first ironclad warship in the Royal Navy, which was built by Thames Ironworks.[130] The original colours of the team were dark blue, due to Thames Ironworks chairman Arnold Hills being a former student of Oxford University. However, the team used a variety of kits including the claret and sky blue house colours of Thames Ironworks, as well as sky blue or white kit.[131][132] The Irons permanently adopted claret and blue for home colours in the summer of 1899. Thames Ironworks right-half Charlie Dove received the Aston Villa kit from his father William Dove, who was a professional sprinter of national repute, as well as being involved with the coaching at Thames Ironworks. Bill Dove had been at a fair in Birmingham, close to Villa Park, the home ground of Aston Villa and was challenged to a race against four Villa players, who wagered money that one of them would win.[133] Bill Dove defeated them and, when they were unable to pay the bet, one of the Villa players who was responsible for washing the teams kit offered a complete teams football kits to Dove in payment. The Aston Villa player subsequently reported to his club that the kit was missing.[134] This, however, is often disputed. The predecessors of Thames Ironworks, Old Castle Swifts FC, played in pale blue shirts, white shorts and claret socks as early as 1892, around the same time Aston Villa played in said same colours. Thames Ironworks, and later West Ham United, retained the claret yoke/blue sleeves design, but also continued to use their previously favoured colours for their away kits. Since January 2015 West Hams shirts have been sponsored by Betway.[135] Previous sponsors have included AVCO Trust (198389), BAC Windows (198993), Dagenham Motors (199397), Dr. Martens (19982003), JobServe (200307), XL.com (200708), SBOBET (200813), and Alpari FX (201315).[136] The deal with XL ended early due to the XL Leisure Group being placed in administration in September 2008.[137][138] During this period, players had their squad numbers ironed over the existing sponsorship logo, before a deal with SBOBET was finalised.[139] The deal with Alpari also ended early, because of the sponsor entering liquidation.[140] The current kit manufacturers, Umbro, have made West Hams kit from 2007 to 2010, and from 2015 to the present. Previous manufacturers have been Admiral (197680), Adidas (198087, 201315),[141] Scoreline (198789), Bukta (198993), Pony (199399), Fila (19992003), Reebok (200307) and macron (201013). Im forever blowing bubbles, Pretty bubbles in the air.\nThey fly so high, nearly reach the sky,\nThen like my dreams they fade and die.\nFortunes always hiding,\nIve looked everywhere...\nIm forever blowing bubbles,\npretty bubbles in the air. The teams supporters are famous for their rendition of the chorus of their teams anthem, Im Forever Blowing Bubbles introduced to the club by former manager Charlie Paynter in the late 1920s. A Pears soap commercial featuring the curly haired child in the Millais Bubbles was well known at the time. The child resembled a player, Billy J. Bubbles Murray, from local schoolboy team, Park School, where the headmaster was Cornelius Beal. Beal was known locally for his music and rhyme and wrote special words to the tune of Im Forever Blowing Bubbles whenever any player was having a good game.[143] Beal was a friend of Paynter, while Murray was a West Ham trialist and played football at schoolboy level with a number of West Ham players such as Jim Barrett. Through this contrivance of association the clubs fans took it upon themselves to begin singing the popular music hall tune before home games, sometimes reinforced by the presence of a house band requested to play the refrain by Charlie Paynter.[142] There is a slight change to the lyrics sung by the Upton Park faithful. The second lines nearly reach the sky is changed to they reach the sky, Then like my dreams is also changed to And like my dreams. In addition the fans begin a chant of United, United! to cap it off.[144] Bow Bells are ringing, for the Claret and Blue, Bow Bells are ringing, for the Claret and Blue, When the Hammers are scoring, and the South Bank are roaring, And the money is pouring, for the Claret and Blue, Claret and Blue, No relegation for the Claret and Blue, Just celebration for the Claret and Blue, One day well win a cup or two, or three, Or four or more, for West Ham and the Claret and Blue. The 1975 FA Cup version  which contains the original lyrics, and features vocals from the teams then-current players  is always played before home games, with the home crowd joining in and carrying the song on after the music stops at the verse line Fortunes always hiding.[146] Bubbles was published as a waltz whereas during the game the crowd sing it in common time.[146][147] Like other teams, the team also have a history of adopting or adapting popular songs of the day to fit particular events, themes, players or personas. These have included serious renditions of theatre and movie classics such as The Bells are Ringing, along with more pun-laden or humorous efforts, such as chanting former player Paolo Di Canios name to the canzone La donna  mobile by Giuseppe Verdi,[148] or D.I. Canio to the tune of Ottawans D.I.S.C.O., or the chant of Who Let The Potts Out? to the tune of Baha Mens Who Let the Dogs Out? when Steve Potts could be seen warming up to come on as substitute late on in his career, or Thats Zamora to the tune of Dean Martins 1953 Thats Amore in honour of former striker Bobby Zamora. Other former players to be serenaded include Christian Dailly with vastly-altered lyrics to Frankie Vallis Cant Take My Eyes Off You,[149] Joe Cole and Carlton Cole with Spandau Ballets Gold song title sung as Cole[150] and Ludk Mikloko. A song for West Ham favourite Bobby Moore, Viva Bobby Moore, is also sung based on The Businesss Oi! rendition of the song, based on The Equals 1969 release Viva Bobby Joe.[151] In 2016, supporters adapted the lyrics of Billy Ray Cyrus Achy Breaky Heart in honour of Dimitri Payet.[152] Fans gained national attention after giving a torrid time to David Beckham in his first away match of 199899 the season after the England midfielder was sent off for a petulant foul on Diego Simeone.[153] Coinciding with the game, there were claims (and an image taken) that fans, organised by a hardcore, had hung an effigy of the player outside a local pub. Although it was later revealed that the pub was in South-East London, the heartland of West Hams greatest rivals Millwall. The West Ham fans did, however, boo Beckhams every touch of the ball during the game.[154] They have also displayed a particular zeal when it comes to abusing former players particularly those who are perceived to have abandoned the club, or performed some disservice. Famously Paul Ince,[155][156] Frank Lampard,[157] Jermain Defoe,[158] and Nigel Reo-Coker[159] have borne the brunt of verbal assaults and a guaranteed hostile reception at Upton Park. However, players such as Joe Cole, Michael Carrick, Rio Ferdinand, Bobby Zamora and Carlos Tevez receive applause and even standing ovations in honour of their contributions during their time at the club. Joe Cole subsequently rejoined West Ham from Liverpool midway through the 201213 season.[160] The origins of West Hams links with organised football-related violence starts in the 1960s with the establishment of The Mile End Mob (named after an area of the East End of London).[161] During the 1970s and 80s (the main era for organised football-related violence), West Ham gained further notoriety for the levels of hooliganism in their fan base and antagonistic behaviour towards both their own and rival fans, and the police. During the 70s in particular, rival groups of West Ham fans from neighbouring areas often did battle with each other at games, most often groups from the neighbouring districts of Barking and Dagenham.[162] The Inter City Firm were one of the first casuals, so called because they avoided police supervision by not wearing football-related clothing and travelled to away matches on regular InterCity trains, rather than on the cheap and more tightly policed football special charter trains. The group were an infamous West Ham-aligned gang. As the firms moniker inter city suggests violent activities were not confined to local derbies  the hooligans were content to cause trouble at any game, though nearby teams often bore the brunt.[162] The 2005 independent film Green Street starring Elijah Wood and Charlie Hunnam focuses on a firm of West Ham hooligans.[163] West Ham have strong rivalries with several other clubs. Most of these are with other London clubs, especially with Tottenham Hotspur in an East versus North London derby[164] and with Chelsea in an East versus West London rivalry. The rivalry between West Ham and Tottenham has been fuelled by players such as Michael Carrick, Martin Peters, Paul Allen, Jermain Defoe and Scott Parker leaving the Hammers to join Tottenham.[165] The rivalry deepened with the appointment of former Hammers manager Harry Redknapp as Tottenhams manager.[166] Since the 200607 Premier League season, West Ham have developed a strong rivalry with Yorkshire club Sheffield United due to the dubious circumstances surrounding the transfer of Carlos Tevez, who helped West Ham avoid relegation at Sheffield Uniteds expense.[167][168] The oldest and fiercest rivalry is with Millwall. The two sides are local rivals, having both formed originally around local companies, with players living in the same localities. The early history of both clubs are intertwined, with West Ham proving to be the more successful in a number of meetings between the two teams at the time, resulting in West Ham being promoted at the expense of Millwall. Millwall later declined to join the fledgling Football League while West Ham went on to the top division and an FA Cup final. Later in the 1920s, the rivalry was intensified during strike action which Isle of Dogs-based companies (i.e., Millwall fans) refused to support, breeding ill will between the two camps, the bitterness of this betrayal enduring for years. In 1972, a Millwall supporter died at New Cross station after falling out of a train during a fight with West Ham fans. [169] The rivalry between West Ham and Millwall has involved considerable violence and is one of the most notorious within the world of football hooliganism. The teams were drawn against each other in the second round of the 200910 League Cup and met on 25 August 2009 at Upton Park. This was the first time in four years that the two clubs had played each other, and the first ever in the League Cup. Clashes between fans occurred outside the ground, resulting in violence erupting up to half a mile away from the stadium, with serious injuries, include the stabbing of a Millwall supporter, damage to property and several arrests reported by police. There were also several pitch invasions by West Ham supporters which brought a temporary halt to the game.[170] In January 2010, West Ham were fined after being found guilty of violent, threatening, obscene and provocative behaviour and of failing to prevent their fans entering the field of play. Millwall were cleared of all charges.[171] The team and supporters are known as The Hammers, in part because of the clubs origins as Thames Ironworks.[172] They are also known as The Irons[172] and The Cockney Boys.[173] Other nicknames are The Academy of Football, or just The Academy.[174] Until 2016, West Ham were based at the Boleyn Ground, commonly known as Upton Park, in Newham, East London. The capacity of the Boleyn Ground was 35,016,[175] and had been West Hams ground since 1904. Prior to this, in their previous incarnation of Thames Ironworks, they played at Hermit Road in Canning Town and briefly at Browning Road in East Ham, before moving to the Memorial Grounds in Plaistow in 1897. They retained the stadium during their transition to becoming West Ham United and were there for a further four seasons before moving to the Boleyn Ground in 1904. Former chairman Eggert Magnsson made clear his ambition for West Ham to move to the Olympic Stadium after the 2012 Summer Olympics, a desire reiterated by current chairmen Gold and Sullivan when they assumed control of the club stating that they felt it was a logical move for the Government as it was in the borough of Newham. In February 2010, however, the British Olympic Minister stated that West Ham would not get the stadium, and it would instead be used for track and field.[176] On 17 May 2010, West Ham and Newham London Borough Council submitted a formal plan to the Olympic Park Legacy Company for the use of the Olympic Stadium following the 2012 Olympic Games. The proposal was for a stadium with a capacity of 60,000 which would retain a competition athletics track. The proposal was welcomed by the chairman of UK athletics, Ed Warner, who said, I think it will feel great as a football stadium and I speak as a football fan as well the chairman of UK Athletics. I think youd find West Ham would cover the track in the winter season so it wouldnt look like you had a track between you and the pitch.[177][178] On 30 September 2010, the club formally submitted its bid for the Olympic Stadium with a presentation at 10 Downing Street,[179] and on 8 October 2010 the worlds largest live entertainment company, Live Nation, endorsed the clubs Olympic Stadium plans.[180] Three days after Live Nations endorsement, UK Athletics confirmed its formal support for West Ham United and Newham Council in their joint bid to take over the Olympic Stadium in legacy mode.[181] In November 2010, West Ham commenced a search for potential developers for informal discussions about what would happen to the ground if it were to win its bid to take over the Olympic Stadium after the 2012 Games. According to the club, the site could be vacated and open to redevelopment by the summer of 2014.[182] On 11 February 2011, the Olympic Park Legacy Committee selected West Ham as the preferred club to move into the Olympic Stadium after the 2012 Games.[183][184] The decision in favour of West Hams bid was unanimous,[185] although controversial as local rivals Tottenham Hotspur had also been bidding for the venue.[186] Hopes of moving to the stadium, however, were since placed under doubt following a legal challenge by Tottenham and Leyton Orient, with Leyton Orient fearful that having West Ham playing less than a mile away from their Brisbane Road ground could steal support from the club and put them out of business.[187] Both clubs appeal for a judicial review, however, were rejected on 23 June 2011.[188] On 3 March 2011, West Hams proposed move to the Olympic Stadium was formally approved by the British government and Mayor of London Boris Johnson. On 8 June 2011, it was confirmed that the Westfield Shopping Centre had been in detailed talks with West Ham for naming rights of the new Olympic stadium which could be called the Westfield Stadium.[189] West Ham announced plans to move from the Boleyn Ground from the 201415 season.[190] In August 2011, an independent investigation initiated by the Olympic Park Legacy Company upheld the decision to award West Ham the Olympic Stadium after the 2012 Games.[191] On 29 June 2011, however, Tottenham announced that they were returning to the High Court again to fight the decision to award West Ham the stadium, in an oral hearing, to try and overturn the original high court appeal being rejected.[192] On 25 August 2011, Tottenham and Leyton Orient were in fact granted a judicial review by the High Court into the Olympic Stadium bidding process.[193] On 11 October 2011, the deal to award West Ham the Olympic Stadium collapsed over concerns of legal pressure, with the government deciding that the stadium will stay in public ownership.[194] Six days later, Tottenham and Leyton Orient announced they had ended their legal challenge after the deal collapsed.[195] Once the original deal collapsed, a new process to select a tenant was begun. West Ham immediately announced plans to become tenants of the stadium.[196] By March 2012, West Ham was one of the four bidders for the Stadium. With a decision due by the Olympic Park Legacy Company in May 2012, Mayor of London Boris Johnson delayed the final selection of future tenants until completion of the 2012 Summer Olympics, stating that it was overwhelmingly likely that the tenants would be West Ham.[197][198] It was announced on 22 March 2013 that West Ham had signed a 99-year lease for the Olympic Stadium after the government agreed to put in an extra million towards the costs of converting the site. The clubs plan was to move into the stadium prior to the start of the 201617 season.[199] Supporters of rival clubs had pressed for an inquiry into the granting of West Hams tenancy, arguing that West Ham were being given an unfair advantage by the arrangement. In September 2015, however, the government rejected holding such an inquiry.[200] The Bobby Moore Stand The East Stand Facing north, The Sir Trevor Brooking stand The club promotes the popular idea of West Ham being The Academy of Football, with the moniker adorning the grounds new stadium faade. The comment predominantly refers to the clubs youth development system which was established by manager Ted Fenton during the 1950s, that has seen a number of international players emerge through the ranks.[201] Most notably, the club contributed three players to the World Cup-winning England side of 1966, including club icon Bobby Moore, as well as Martin Peters and Geoff Hurst who between them scored all of Englands goals in the eventual 42 victory. Other academy players that have gone on to play for England have included Trevor Brooking, Alvin Martin, Tony Cottee and Paul Ince. Since the late 1990s, Rio Ferdinand, Frank Lampard, Joe Cole, Michael Carrick and Glen Johnson began their careers at West Ham and all went on to play for much bigger clubs. Most recently, the likes of first teamers Mark Noble and James Tomkins, as well as Welsh international Jack Collison, have emerged through the Academy. Frustratingly for fans and managers alike,[202] the club has struggled to retain many of these players due to (predominantly) financial reasons.[203] West Ham, during the 200708 season, had an average of 6.61 English players in the starting line up, higher than any other Premier League club,[204] which cemented their status as one of the few Premier League clubs left that were recognised to be bringing through young English talent and were recognised as having homegrown players. Between 2000 and 2011, the club produced eight England players, as many as Manchester United and one fewer than Arsenal.[205] Much of the success of The Academy has been attributed to Tony Carr, who has been West Ham youth coach since 1973.[206] Note: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules.

In the 2003 book The Official West Ham United Dream Team, 500 fans were quizzed for who would be in their all time Hammers Eleven. The voting was restricted to players from the modern era.  The following is a list of the Hammer of the Year award won by West Ham United players.[212] Trevor Brooking was the first player for West Ham United to have been honoured with the title of Hammer of the Year three times in a row in 1976, 1977 and 1978. Scott Parker repeated this feat between 20092011.[213] Brooking has won the award the most times, on five occasions: 1972, 1976, 1977, 1978 and 1984. Bobby Moore, Billy Bonds and Julian Dicks have each won it four times. Bobby Moore has been runner-up four times, while Billy Bonds and Tony Cottee have both been runners-up three times. Billy Bonds and Trevor Brookings wins are notable in the amount of time between first and last Hammer of the Year award. Bonds has 16 years separating his wins whilst Brooking has 12. In 2013, West Ham United introduced a new annual award, the West Ham United Lifetime Achievement Award. The first award was presented to club-record appearance maker Billy Bonds, who picked up the award on the pitch at Upton Park before kick-off against Cardiff City on the opening day of the 201314 season.[214] The 2014 award was presented to Sir Trevor Brooking, a record five-time winner of the Hammer of the Year award. Brooking received the award before the 201415 season curtain-raiser against Tottenham Hotspur on 16 August 2014.[215] Brooking had already had the Centenary Stand at the Boleyn ground named after him in 2009. The 2015 award was awarded to Martin Peters.[216] On 3 May 2016, it was announced via the clubs official website that the fourth recipient of the award would be Sir Geoff Hurst, the clubs second all-time leading goalscorer, and scorer of a hat-trick in the 1966 World Cup Final. Hurst would be honoured at the clubs 2015/16 Player Awards Ceremony.[217] West Ham have had only fifteen permanent managers in their history and an additional three caretaker managers. The current manager is Slaven Bili who was appointed on 9 June 2015.[120] In January 2010, David Sullivan and David Gold acquired a 50 share in West Ham, given them overall operational and commercial control.[223] At the end of May 2010, Gold and Sullivan purchased a further 10 stake in the club at a cost of million. Taking their controlling stake to 60, they announced that they could open up shares for fans to purchase.[224] On 9 August 2010, Gold and Sullivan increased their shares up to 30.6 each with minority investors, (which included former owner Terry Brown, purchasing a further 3.8 of the club at a cost of around 4 million) leaving Icelandic Straumur Investment Bank owning 35 of the club.[225] On 2 July 2013, Sullivan acquired a further 25 of shares after restructuring the debt of the club, leaving Straumur Bank with just 10.[226] In order to clear club debts before a move to the Olympic Stadium in 2016, in December 2014 Sullivan announced the availability for sale of 20 of the club.[227] The clearing of club debts, given in July 2013 as million, was given as a pre-condition to a move to the Olympic Stadium.[228] [229] Follow link to Official West Ham United Records Page[235] Appearances Goals

the top tier of English football. Swansea City represent England when playing in European competitions, although they have represented Wales in the past. The club was founded in 1912 as Swansea Town and joined the Football League in 1921. The club changed their name in 1969, when they adopted the name Swansea City to reflect Swanseas new status as a city.[3] Swansea have played their home matches at the Liberty Stadium since 2005, having previously played at the Vetch Field since the club was founded. In 1981, the club was promoted to the original Football League First Division. It was during the following season they came close to winning the league title, but a decline then set near the seasons end before finishing sixth, although a club record. It was from here the club suffered a relegation the season after, returning to the Football League Fourth Division a few seasons later, then narrowly avoided relegation to the Football Conference in 2003. The Swansea City Supporters Society Ltd owns 20 of the club,[4] with their involvement hailed by Supporters Direct as the most high profile example of the involvement of a supporters trust in the direct running of a club.[5] The clubs subsequent climb from the fourth division of English football to the top division is chronicled in the 2014 film, Jack to a King  The Swansea Story. In 2011, Swansea were promoted to the Premier League. On 24 February 2013, Swansea beat Bradford City 50 to win the 201213 Football League Cup (the competitions highest ever winning margin for the final), winning the first major trophy in the clubs history and qualifying for the 201314 UEFA Europa League, where they reached the Last 32 stage but lost over two legs to SSC Napoli.[6]   The area around Swansea traditionally had been a rugby area, and despite previous attempts by a football club named Swansea Villa, there were no notable football clubs until the establishment of Swansea Town AFC in the summer of 1912. Following the lead of many other South Wales sides, the club joined the second division of the Southern League for the following season. J. W. Thorpe was the clubs first chairman. A site owned by Swansea Gaslight Co., called Vetch Field due to the vegetables that grew there, was rented to be the clubs ground. The clubs first professional match was a 11 draw at the Vetch Field against Cardiff City on 7 September 1912. During that first season the Welsh Cup was won for the first time, and the following season the Swans became the first side to reach the First Round of the FA Cup. Blackburn Rovers were the first First Division side to the visit Vetch Field for a competitive game in the 19141915 FA Cup  Blackburn Rovers were then the Champions of England, but Swansea Town from the Second Division of the Southern League beat them 10 at Vetch Field, Swanseas goal coming from Ben Beynon,[7] while Blackburn Rovers penalty taker Bradshaw missed a penalty. Before the game Bradshaw had scored with thirty-six consecutive spot kicks. Remarkably, the Swans played most of the second half with ten men and the final 15 minutes with just nine men as two players were forced to retire through injury.[8][9] The Swans drew at another First Division side, Newcastle United, in the next round, before losing narrowly in the replay. Following the First World War the Southern League dropped its second division, and with many clubs dropping out due to financial difficulties, the Swans were placed in the first division. After just four seasons in the Southern League, Swansea Town became founder members of the new Third Division of The Football League in 1920 and then Division Three (South) the following season. After five seasons in Division Three (South) and a few failed bids for promotion, the Swans reached the Second Division for the first time in 1925, beating Exeter City 21 at home on the final day of the season to beat perennial runners-up Plymouth Argyle to the Championship. The side had remained unbeaten at home in the league all season  something the next promotion team would emulate over twenty years later. The following season the Swans reached the semi-finals of the FA Cup for the first time, beating Exeter City, Watford, Blackpool, Stoke City, Millwall and Arsenal on the way to playing the Bolton Wanderers at White Hart Lane. Sadly for the Swans, an experienced Bolton side won the game 30 and went on to win the cup. Swans record their highest average attendance during the season of 16,118 for pre-war league games. During the 192627 season they beat Real Madrid 30 on tour and reached the FA Cup quarter-finals before losing 31 to Reading at the Vetch Field. During the 193132 season they finished 1st and went out in the 3rd round of the FA Cup. However they won the Welsh Cup after beating Wrexham 20 away after a replay, Cyril Pearce scored 35 league goals from 40 games league appearances during the season. It was not until the 193334 season that Wilfred Milne scored his first goal for Swansea at Lincoln City after 501 appearances without a goal. In the 193536 season the Swans set a league record for longest distance travelled between consecutive matches, Good Friday Swans played at Plymouth (21), and Easter Saturday Swans played at Newcastle United (12). After just one season back from wartime football, the Swans finished 21st in the Second Division, and thus returned to Division Three (South) for the first time since 1925. The following season was one of consolidation, however in 19481949 the Swans stormed their way to winning the division for the second time. Only one point was dropped at home all season as the feat of the 1925 promotion side was emulated, with the side finishing a whole seven points ahead of second placed Reading. Billy McCandless was the manager who led the side to promotion, and in doing so he completed a rare hat-trick of winning the Third Division (South) title with all three South Wales clubs  and without losing a home game with Swansea or Cardiff. Following promotion, the Swans had another 15 years of Second Division football to look forward to, however despite what successive managers and chairmen were to say, Swansea Town only once during that time looked like they could genuinely challenge for promotion. That came in the 195556 season, when a side containing the likes of Ivor Allchurch, Terry Medwin, Harry Griffiths and Tom Kiley led the table early in the season, before an injury to Kiley, referred to as the linchpin of the side, in mid-November led to a decline in form. He was never adequately replaced, but despite this and the sale of some of the clubs best players, the side remained in contention for promotion until the beginning of April. Following a 61 win over second placed Leicester City at the Vetch Field at the end of March the side was just two points behind second placed Liverpool with a game in hand  however subsequent results were not as encouraging, and they eventually slipped away to finish tenth. In 1964, the Swans reached a second FA Cup semi-final, beating Barrow, Sheffield United and Stoke City en route to a famous sixth round victory at Anfield. Few gave the Swans, struggling for their lives at the bottom of Division Two, any chance of causing an upset against the league leaders. But the Swans were 02 up at half-time thanks to Jimmy McLaughlin and Eddie Thomas. Liverpool turned up the pressure in the second half, pulling a goal back before being awarded a penalty nine minutes from time. Ronnie Moran had established an excellent record as a penalty taker, but he failed to beat the excellent Noel Dwyer on this occasion. Fellow second division side Preston North End awaited in the semi-final at Villa Park, but despite taking the lead through McLaughlin again, the Swans were to be denied by a second half penalty and a wonder goal from nearly 40yards. After flirting with relegation on a few occasions during the previous seasons, the Swans luck finally ran out a season later in 1965, and they were back in the Third Division. Following relegation, Trevor Morris, who had been manager since 1958, was sacked and Glyn Davies, a former Swansea player, was appointed in his place. Davies re-signed the 36-year-old Ivor Allchurch from Cardiff City, but despite winning the Welsh Cup, the season saw some of the clubs heaviest defeats, and the manager only lasted the season. Relegation to Division Four followed in 1967 and Ivor Allchurch retired. The 196768 season saw the record attendance of 32,796 at the Vetch Field for an FA Cup Fourth Round match against Arsenal. A tragedy struck the club on 20 January 1969 when players Roy Evans and Brian Purcell were killed in a car crash on the way to a game.[10] In 1969, the club name was changed to Swansea City, and Roy Bentleys side celebrated by securing promotion back to the Third Division. A record run of 19 matches unbeaten provided the foundations for a promotion challenge in 197172, but an awful run towards the end of the season resulted in a mid-table finish. A poor start the following season, combined with falling attendances, saw Bentley resign, and he was replaced by Harry Gregg. Gregg failed to stop the rot and the club was back in the Fourth Division for 197374 season. A record low crowd of just 1,358 watched the Swans against Northampton Town, and the following season the Swans were forced to apply for re-election to the football league after a last day defeat at Rochdale condemned them to a 21st-place finish. The application was a success, although by now former player Harry Griffiths had replaced Gregg as manager. Malcolm Struel also took over as chairman, having previously been on the board, and promised a return to former glories, stating that he would not sell the clubs best young talent as previous boards had done. Despite promising performances during the first half of the 197778 season, Harry Griffiths resigned as Swansea Citys manager in February 1978, doubting his own ability to take the club any further. The new manager was former Liverpool, Cardiff City and Wales striker John Toshack. On 1 March 1978, at 28 years old, Toshack became the youngest manager in the Football League, with Griffiths as his assistant. Thus began a remarkable climb from the Fourth Division to the top of the entire league. Despite relinquishing his role as manager before the end of the season, this was Griffiths team, and the promotion from the Fourth Division was largely his doing. During this season, the Swans record league win was achieved (80 against Hartlepool United). Before promotion was secured, however, Harry Griffiths died of a heart attack on 25 April 1978 before the home game against Scunthorpe United. A further promotion was achieved next season and the club returned to the Second Division after an absence of 14 years, with Toshack himself coming off the bench to score the winning goal against Chesterfield and thus secure promotion. After a season of consolidation, Swansea City again challenged for promotion and travelled to Preston North End on 2 May 1981 in the knowledge that victory would assure them a place in the First Division for the first time in the clubs history. A 31 win guaranteed a third promotion in four seasons and Swansea City joined the footballing elite. The goalscorers on that historic day at Deepdale were Tommy Craig, Leighton James and Jeremy Charles. The four-year rise from basement to top division is a record in English football, held jointly with Wimbledon F.C.[11] Coincidentally, the Swansea decline started the same year as the Wimbledon rise. Swansea also won the Welsh Cup that season, qualifying for Europe for the first time since the 196566 season.[12] The 198182 season began as implausibly as recent history had suggested it might. The fixture computer handed Swanseas upstarts a first-day home game against Leeds United, which Swansea promptly won 51 with a hat-trick by debutant Bob Latchford. Swansea had swept from the basement division to the top of the entire Football League in barely three years. Victories over footballing royalty such as Liverpool, Manchester United, Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur followed as the club topped the league on several further occasions. However, injuries to key players took their toll, and the lack of depth in the squad meant that the season ended in sixth-place finish. Furthermore, a fateful combination of poor form, misfortune in the transfer market and financial problems led to a slump which was as quick and spectacular as had been the rise: two consecutive relegations followed, and Toshack was sacked. By 1985, the club was battling for its very survival on two fronts. Whilst its creditors lined up a High Court hearing with the aim of liquidating the club, Swansea City had come to rely on a combination of old stagers and young professionals. Wound up by court order in December 1985, Swansea City was saved by local businessman Doug Sharpe who took over the running of the club, although the change of ownership was not enough to prevent relegation to the Fourth Division in 1986. Eight years on from the first promotion under Toshack, the club was back where it had started. Swansea won promotion from the Fourth Division in 1988  beating Rotherham United and Torquay United over two legs in the inaugural playoffs. They remained in the leagues third tier for the next eight seasons  the longest period of stability the club had seen since the war. Doug Sharpe may have kept the purse strings tight, but under Terry Yorath and then Frank Burrows, the club managed to stay in the Second Division, reach the playoff semi-finals in 1993 and make their first Wembley appearance a year later. Burrows guided the Swans to within 180minutes of Wembley in 1993  a run of five wins in the last six league matches (all at home) secured a playoff place, and with five minutes remaining of the first leg of the semi-final against West Bromwich Albion, the Swans were 20 up. Andy McFarlane scored an own goal when the ball rebounded off the crossbar then into the net off his knee to give West Brom a lifeline, and two early goals in the second leg gave the Baggies the advantage, until midfielder Micky Mellon was sent off. Burrows threw on Colin West, however within minutes of coming on the former West Brom striker was sent off, and ended any hopes of a Wembley final. Although the league campaign the following season did not live up the previous one, mainly due to the sale of key players, Burrows guided the Swans to Wembley for the first time in their history for the final of the Autoglass Trophy. Wins over Plymouth Argyle & Exeter City in the group stage followed by triumphs over Exeter again, Port Vale, Leyton Orient and Wycombe Wanderers over two legs saw the Swans play Huddersfield Town in a final that finished 11. Chairman Doug Sharpe brought back the famous hat, and the Swans went on to win 31 on penalties. The following season failed to live up to expectations, although the club again reached the semi-finals of the Auto Windscreens Shield, eventually going out to Birmingham City, and an eventful FA Cup run saw them win at Middlesbrough in a third round replay, before going out to Newcastle United at St James Park. The 199596 season ended with relegation back to the third division after eight years. The Swans were doing fine around Christmas time, but a complete collapse in the second half of the season, including a 70 FA Cup defeat at third division Fulham, 40 and 51 defeats at Blackpool and Oxford United respectively, relegation was inevitable, despite the arrival of Jan Mlby. Relegation in 1996 was accompanied by an unfortunate statistic: never before had the club been managed by four men in the same season. Most embarrassing was the appointment of Kevin Cullis as manager by a consortium wishing to buy the club. Cullis, whose previous experience was with non-league Midlands club Cradley Town youth team, was certainly not the big name manager promised by the new owners. Alarmed at developments at the club, outgoing chairman Doug Sharpe invoked a contractual clause to cancel the deal and resumed control himself: Cullis was promptly sacked after just six days. During his short-lived reign, his evident lack of ability led to senior players Christian Edwards and Dave Penney ejecting Cullis from the dressing room during half time and giving the team talk themselves in a 40 defeat to Blackpool, which proved to be his second and last game in charge. Culliss successor was the Dane, Jan Mlby, a former Liverpool player taking his first steps in management. His appointment inevitably prompted comparison with the Toshack era which began nearly 20 years earlier. Despite relegation in 1996, the club reached the final of the 1997 Third Division promotion play-offs but lost to Northampton Town, whose goal came from a re-taken free kick by John Frain in the final minute. Mlby was sacked just weeks into the following season, with Swansea struggling near the foot of the league. After the initial optimism, the Liverpool connection had not caused history to repeat itself. Alan Cork was appointed as manager, but was dismissed after leading the club to its lowest league finish for 23 years. John Hollins was appointed, and things soon started to improve. In 1999, the club reached the promotion playoffs, only to lose in extra time at Scunthorpe United. The season was also notable for a third round FA Cup victory over Premiership opponents West Ham United, whose team included Frank Lampard, Joe Cole, Rio Ferdinand and John Hartson. Swansea thus became the first bottom division team to defeat a Premiership club in the FA Cup since the re-organisation of the league structure in 1992. The club was promoted in 2000 as Division Three champions, following a nail-biting championship decider on the final day of the season against second-placed Rotherham United. Hollins side certainly proved to be effective and functional, rather than pretty, seemingly winning 10 every week on their way to the title. The side conceded just 32 goals during the 19992000 season, largely due to the form of excellent centre-back pairing Jason Smith and Matthew Bound, as well as keeper Roger Freestone. During the season the side set a record of nine consecutive league victories, and, during the same period, seven consecutive clean sheets. Striker Walter Boyd also set an unwanted record of being the fastest substitute ever sent off, when he was red-carded for striking a Darlington player seconds after being brought on and before play had resumed, therefore being officially recorded as zero seconds. Promotion was secured courtesy of a 30 win over Exeter City at a packed Vetch Field. However, the following weeks 11 draw at Rotherham United, which confirmed Swansea as Division Three Champions, was overshadowed by the death of supporter Terry Coles, who was trampled to death by a police horse in narrow Millmoor Lane before the game. Despite significant optimism on the terraces, it was clear that the team was not strong enough to survive in the higher division and relegation occurred in May 2001, just 12 months after promotion. Hollins had failed to strengthen the side at all during the summer, and despite a decent start, a 51 defeat at big-spending Reading in September led to a disastrous slide down the table, and the side won just eight games all season, and were saved from bottom spot only by Oxford United being even worse. Hollins certainly was not helped by lack of investment from the board and injury to key players, but the fans patience wore thin as his continual insistence that the squad was good enough to survive grew more comical by the week. Relegation seemed certain following a 53 defeat at fellow strugglers Luton Town, where Giovanni Savarese scored a hat-trick, however Hollins maintained that the side could stay up, even when 18 points were needed from the final six matches, and for two other teams to pick up no more points. In July 2001, following relegation back to Third Division, the club was sold to managing director Mike Lewis for 1. Lewis subsequently sold on his stake to a consortium of Australian businessmen behind the Brisbane Lions (An Australian Rules Football team that is based in Brisbane) football team, fronted by Tony Petty. Seven players were sacked and eight others saw their contracts terminated, angering supporters and sanctions were threatened by the Football League with a rival consortium headed by ex-player Mel Nurse seeking to buy out the new owners. During this period Hollins was sacked after a poor start to the season, and Colin Addison took over as manager. The turmoil led to the creation of the Swansea City Supporters Trust, which sought to save the club and ultimately guarantee supporter representation on the clubs board. The Petty group sold its stake in January 2002 after a bitter stand-off with the Nurse consortium, which was supported by the majority of the clubs fans. Jim Moore and Mel Griffin, previously rescuers of Hull City FC, stepped into the breach and persuaded Petty to sell to them (as he had promised to bankrupt the club & make it extinct rather than sell to Nurse). From there Moore became Chairman for three weeks giving the Mel Nurse Consortium time to organize its finances. Having successfully reorganized the finances of Hull City FC, both Moore & Griffin were believers in clubs belonging in the hands of local people, and so believing Nurses group were best for The Swans, subsequently passed the club onto Nurses consortium for the fee of 1. Despite problems off the pitch, Addisons side had managed a mid-table position, but lack of funds led to his dismissal in early March, and under Nick Cusack the club slumped to a 20th placed-finish. Cusack lasted just eight games into the following season, and was sacked after a 10 defeat at league debutants Boston United had put the Swans on the bottom of the Football League for the first time in its 91-year history. He was replaced by Brian Flynn. Swansea City avoided relegation to the Football Conference on the last day of the season, at the expense of Exeter City, a club then vice-chaired by Mike Lewis. Brian Flynns side finished 200304 10th and reached the fifth round of the FA Cup for the first time in 24 years, eventually losing 21 at Tranmere Rovers. Flynn was dismissed and replaced by Kenny Jackett. Jackett lost his first six matches in charge, ending any hope of a play-off place. The following season Jackett recruited a number of new defensive players and set a record of seven consecutive home clean sheets, all victories. The Swans last season at the Vetch Field saw the club win promotion on the last day of the season, clinching a 3rd-placed finish with a 10 win away to Bury. Their last league game at their old ground was a 10 win over Shrewsbury Town, with the last game of any sort being a 21 win against Wrexham in the final of the 2005 FAW Premier Cup.  The club moved to the new Liberty Stadium during the summer of 2005. The first competitive game was a 10 victory against Tranmere Rovers in August 2005. In their first season back in League One, Swansea, after beating Brentford in the semi-finals, lost on penalties to Barnsley in the final at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff. That same season, Swansea won the Football League Trophy for the first time since 1994, and the FAW Premier Cup for a second successive year. In the following season Jackett resigned as manager in mid-season to be replaced by Roberto Martnez. Martnezs arrival saw an improvement in form, but Swansea missed out on the play-offs again. The following season, an 18-game unbeaten run helped them to the League One title. The club amassed a total of 92 points over the course of the season, the highest ever by a Welsh club in the Football League. Five Swansea players were in the PFA Team of the Year, including the divisions 29-goal top scorer Jason Scotland. That same season Swansea lost on penalties to Milton Keynes Dons in the area final of the Football League Trophy. Upon returning to the second tier of English football after 24 years Swansea City finished the 200809 season in eighth place, and missed out on the play-offs the following season by a single point. After an impressive 63 wins in 126 games for Swansea City, Martnez left for Wigan Athletic on the 15 June 2009 with his tenure returning just 26 losses in that time. He was replaced by Portuguese Paulo Sousa who adopted a more defensive style of play whilst also retaining the slick and effective continental game of tiki-taka football that was installed by his immediate predecessor. Sousa subsequently left Swansea to take charge at Leicester City on 5 July 2010, lasting just one year and 13 days in South Wales. However, just before the departure of Sousa, on 15 May 2010, Swansea player Besian Idrizaj tragically suffered a heart attack in his native Austria while on international duty. The club retired the number 40 shirt in his memory, and the players wore shirts dedicated to Idrizaj after their victory in the play-off final. Northern Irishman Brendan Rodgers took charge for the 201011 season. He guided the club to a third-placed finish and qualification for the Championship play-offs, with the new manager again keeping the continental style of play introduced by Martnez. After beating Nottingham Forest 31 on aggregate in the semi-final they defeated Reading 42 in the final at Wembley Stadium, with Scott Sinclair scoring a hat-trick.[13]  By being promoted to the Premier League for the 201112 season, Swansea became the first Welsh team to play in the division since its formation in 1992. Swansea signed Danny Graham from Watford for a then-record fee of 3.5 million. They defeated Arsenal, Liverpool and Manchester City, the eventual champions, at home during the season. Swansea finished their debut Premier League season in 11th, but at the end of the season Brendan Rodgers left to manage Liverpool. He was replaced by Michael Laudrup for the 201213 Premier League season. His first league game ended in a 05 victory over Queens Park Rangers away at Loftus Road. This saw Swansea joint top of the Premier League, making it the first time since October 1981 the team had been at the summit of the top tier. Swansea then went top for two hours after beating West Ham United 30 at the Liberty Stadium, with Michu scoring his third goal in two games. On 15 October 2012, the board of directors announced that the club had made a profit of 14.2 million after their first season in the Premier League,[14] and that the expansion of the Liberty Stadium will be conducted in two separate phases when the timing is right for the club.[15] On 1 December, Swansea picked up a 02 away win against Arsenal, with Michu scoring twice during the last minutes of the game, in Swanseas first win at Arsenal in three decades.[16] On 24 February 2013, Swansea beat Bradford City 05 in the League Cup final.[17][18] This triumph, in a record victory, was Swanseas first major piece of silverware and qualified them for the 201314 UEFA Europa League. On 8 April 2013, Swansea announced record profits of 15.9 million for six months up to November 2012, including an 11 increase in commercial revenue. Swansea finished the season in ninth place in the Premier League, improving upon the league standing achieved in the previous season. On 11 July, Swansea paid a club record transfer fee of 12 million to secure the signing of striker Wilfried Bony from Vitesse Arnhem; Bony was the leading goalscorer in the 201213 Eredivisie with 31 goals and was named Dutch Player of the Year.[19] Swansea enjoyed initial success in Europe, beating Spanish side Valencia 30 in September 2013.[20] On 3 November 2013, Swansea City became the first team to lose a Welsh Premier League derby after losing 10 to Cardiff City.[21] However, Swansea City went on to beat Cardiff City 30 at the Liberty Stadium on 8 February 2014.[22] In February 2014, Laudrup was dismissed from the club after a poor run of form. Defender Garry Monk, a Swansea player since 2004, was named as his replacement.[23] During the January 2015 transfer window, Wilfried Bony was sold to Manchester City for a record sale of 25 million, with add-ons that could lead to 28 million. This deal eclipsed the record fee received from Liverpool for Joe Allen, 15 million. Swansea City finished eighth in the Premier League at the end of the 201415 season with 56 points, their highest position and points haul for a Premier League season, and second highest finish in the top flight of all time. During the season, they produced league doubles over Arsenal and Manchester United, becoming only the third team in Premier League history to achieve that feat. On 9 December 2015, Swansea City announced that they had parted ways with manager Garry Monk after one win in eleven matches.[24] The club, after a period with Alan Curtis acting as caretaker manager for the third time, chose the Italian former Udinese Calcio coach Francesco Guidolin. During the 201617 preseason, Swansea City came under new ownership by an American consortium led by Jason Levien and Steve Kaplan, who bought a controlling interest in the club in July 2016.[25] The takeover was confirmed by Swansea City, but chairman Huw Jenkins remained at the club.[26] On 3 October 2016, Guidolin was sacked and replaced by American coach Bob Bradley as the clubs new manager. The selection of Bradley marked the first time a Premier League club had ever hired an American manager.[27] Bradley himself was sacked after just 85 days in charge; he won only two of his 11 games, conceded 29 goals, and left with a win percentage of just 18.1.[28] On 3 January 2017, Bayern Munich assistant manager Paul Clement agreed to take charge of the team, replacing Bradley.[29] During the remainder of the 201617 season, Clement led Swansea to win 26 points from 18 games, securing their survival on May 14.[30] Only three prior teams had climbed from bottom of the table at Christmas to escape relegation, and only one prior team was able to escape relegation while having three managers during a season.[31] Hull City were ultimately relegated in place of Swansea; ironically, they beat Hull City in their final match in 2003 to escape relegation from the fourth division of English football.[32] Before Swansea Town was established, children would play football on waste ground in which a plant, called vetch (a type of legume) was grown. The site was owned by Swansea Gaslight Company in 1912, but was deemed surplus to requirements at the Gas Company. So Swansea Town moved in when they were established in 1912.[33] The ground originally held 12,000, but hit its peak attendance of 32,786 in an 1967 FA cup Fifth Round against Arsenal. The last league goal ever scored at the Vetch was scored by Adrian Forbes, on 30 April 2005, as Swansea beat Shrewsbury Town 10. With a rapidly deteriorating Vetch Field, Swansea looked to relocate. As Swansea and the Ospreys did not have the capital to invest in a new stadium, the Swansea City Council and a developer-led consortia submitted a proposal for a sustainable bowl venue for 20,520 seats on a site to the west of the river on the site of the Morfa Stadium, which the Council owned. It was funded by a 355,000ft retail park on land to the east of the river. The final value of the development being in excess of 50 million. On 23 July 2005, The Liberty Stadium was officially opened as Swansea faced Fulham in a friendly game.[34] The Liberty Stadium capacity was 20,532 though has been increased to 20,750[citation needed]. The highest attendance recorded at the stadium came against Arsenal on 31 October 2015 with 20,937 spectators,[35] beating the previous record of 20,845. The stadium has also hosted three Welsh international football matches; the first being a 00 draw with Bulgaria in 2006,[36] the second a 21 defeat to Georgia in 2008 and a 20 win over Switzerland on 7 October 2011. The first international goal to be scored at the Liberty Stadium was a 25-yard effort from Welsh international Jason Koumas.[37] On 1 July 2012, it was widely reported in national media that Swansea City were beginning the planning phase for expanding the Liberty Stadium by approximately 12,000 seats. This plan would be conditional on a successful second season in the Premier League and could cost up to 15 million; the increase would result in a capacity of approximately 32,000 seats.[38] Later that same year, the board of directors announced that planning applications were to be put forward to the council authority, making the Liberty Stadium the largest sportsclub-owned stadium in Wales.[39] Swansea Citys main rivals are Cardiff City, with the rivalry described as among the most hostile in British football.[40] Matches between these two clubs are known as the South Wales derbies and are usually one of the highlights of the season for both sets of supporters. To a lesser extent, Swansea Citys other rivals are Bristol City, Bristol Rovers and Newport County. However, Swansea very rarely meet Newport as they are currently separated by three divisions, while the two clubs share a mutual rivalry with Cardiff City. Swansea have won 36 of the 106 competitive meetings, compared to Cardiffs 43, who also have the biggest result between the two sides with Swansea losing 50 in 1965, with a further 27 drawn; to this day, neither team has done the double. Following Swansea Citys promotion to the Championship, the clubs were drawn in the League Cup which would be the first meeting between both sides for nine years.[41] Swansea City won the tie with a solitary goal from a deflected free-kick taken by Jordi Gmez. The match saw sets of supporters from both clubs clash with police after the match.[42] The next two league games both finished in 22 draws.[43][44] However, the derby game at Ninian Park was marred with controversy as referee Mike Dean was struck by a coin from a Cardiff City supporter. In the 200910 season, Swansea beat Cardiff 32 at the Liberty Stadium in November, before losing 21 in Cardiff in April after a late Michael Chopra strike. With Swansea and Cardiff both pushing for promotion to the Premier League, the first derby at the new Cardiff City Stadium, and the first Cardiff win in nine meetings between the sides, was billed as being the biggest South Wales derby of all time, in respect to the league positions of the teams and how close it came to the end of the season. Despite their promising league positions leading up to the derby, neither side gained promotion at the end of that campaign, and so the South Wales derby was once again played out at Championship level during the 201011 season  Swansea beating Cardiff 10 away with a late winner from then on-loan Marvin Emnes before losing their home game due to a late strike from Craig Bellamy. Following Swanseas promotion to the Premier League at the end of the 201011 season, the South Wales derby was again put on hiatus. It would be two seasons before the sides met once more, this time on the worldwide stage of the Premier League. On 3 November 2013, Cardiff took the bragging rights in the first ever Premier League South Wales derby, enjoying a 10 win courtesy of ex-Swan Steven Caulker at the Cardiff City Stadium. The return fixture for that season took place on 8 February 2014 at Swanseas Liberty Stadium, a match in which interim player-manager Garry Monk would make his managerial debut following the sacking of Michael Laudrup. The Swans took revenge for the defeat earlier in the season with a convincing 30 win. Swansea Citys first trophy was the Welsh Cup, which they won as Swansea Town in 1913. Their first league honour came in 1925, when they won the 192425 Football League Third Division South title. Since then Swansea have gone on to win the League Cup once, the Football League Trophy twice and the Welsh Cup a further nine times. They have also qualified for UEFA Cup Winners Cup seven times and the UEFA Europa League once. Swansea Citys honours include the following:[45] The Football League Domestic Cup Competition Wilfred Milne holds the record for Swansea appearances, having played 586 matches between 1920 and 1937, closely followed by Roger Freestone with 563 between 1991 and 2004.[46] The player who has won the most international caps while at the club is Ashley Williams with 50 for Wales.[citation needed] The goalscoring record is held by Ivor Allchurch, with 166 goals, scored between 1947 and 1958 and between 1965 and 1968.[47] Cyril Pearce holds the records for the most goals scored in a season, in 193132, with 35 league goals in the Second Division and 40 goals in total.[33] The clubs widest victory margin in the league was 120, a scoreline which they achieved once in the European Cup Winners Cup, against Sliema in 1982.[33][48] They have lost by an eight-goal margin on two occasions, once in the FA Cup, beaten 08 by Liverpool in 1990 and once in the European Cup Winners Cup, beaten 08 by AS Monaco in 1991.[49] Swanseas home attendance record was set at the fourth-round FA Cup tie against Arsenal on 17 February 1968, with 32,796 fans attending the Vetch Field.[33][50] The most expensive player bought was Borja Bastn, who joined from Atltico Madrid in August 2016 for a fee of 15 million.[51] The most expensive sale is Wilfried Bony who joined Manchester City in January 2015 for 28 million.[52] Note: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules.

On the 27 October 2016, Chris Pearlman was appointed the clubs first Chief Operating Officer, reporting directly to the chairman and board of directors. Staff On 27 December 2016, American coach Bob Bradley was sacked by the club after 11 Premier League matches and a win percentage of just 18.1. Fitness coach Pierre Barrieu and assistant coach Paul Williams also left the club. After a period with Alan Curtis in charge, Bayern Munich assistant manager Paul Clement agreed a two-and-a-half year deal to take charge on 3 January 2017.[29] Following Clements arrival, Nigel Gibbs and Claude Makll were appointed his assistant coaches and Karl Halabi was appointed Head of Physical Performance.[69] There have had thirty-seven permanent managers (of whom six have been player-managers), and four caretaker managers of Swansea City since the appointment of the clubs first professional manager, Walter Whittaker in 1912.[72][73] In the clubs first season, Whittaker led Swansea to their first Welsh Cup win.[33] The clubs longest-serving manager, in terms of tenure, was Haydn Green, who held the position for eight years, four months and 14 days, spanning the entirety of World War II.[74] Trevor Morris, who oversaw the most number of games at Swansea, was also the first manager to lead a Welsh club in Europe, qualifying for the 196162 Cup Winners Cup.[33][75] John Toshack, Swansea Citys most successful manager with three league promotions and three Welsh Cup wins, led the club to their highest league finish, sixth place in the 198182 First Division.[33] Appointed in February 1996, the Dane Jan Mlby became Swansea Citys first foreign manager and took Swansea to the 199697 Division Three play-off final, only to lose to a last-minute goal.[33][76] In 2011, Swansea City achieved promotion to the Premier League under Brendan Rodgers, becoming the first Welsh team to play in the division since its formation in 1992.[77] During Swansea Citys centenary year (201213), the club won the League Cup for the first time under Michael Laudrup, the first major trophy in Swanseas 100-year history.[78]

highest level in the English football league system. Founded in 1881 as Watford Rovers, the club entered the FA Cup for the first time in 1886, and the Southern League a decade later. After finishing the 191415 season as Southern League champions under the management of Harry Kent, Watford joined the Football League in 1920. The club played at several grounds in its early history, before moving to a permanent location at Vicarage Road in 1922, where it remains to this day.[5] Watford spent most of the following half century in the lower divisions of The Football League, changing colours and crest on multiple occasions.[6] England manager Graham Taylors tenure at the club saw Watford scale new heights. Between Taylors appointment in 1977 and departure in 1987, Watford rose from the Fourth Division to the First Division. The team finished second in the First Division in the 198283 season, competed in the UEFA Cup in 198384, and also reached the 1984 FA Cup Final.[7] Watford experienced a decade of decline between 1987 and 1997, before Taylor returned as full-time manager, leading the team to successive promotions from the renamed Second Division[a] to the Premier League for one season in 19992000. The club experienced a further one season stint in the top division of English football during the 200607 season, under Aidy Boothroyds management;[9] eight years in the Championship followed. Watford secured promotion in 201415, and have remained in the Premier League since the 201516 season.[10] Watford is currently owned by the Pozzo family, which also owns Udinese Calcio in Italy[2] and previously Granada CF in Spain.[11] Sir Elton John, who owned Watford during both of Graham Taylors successful periods as manager, served alongside Taylor as the clubs joint Honorary Life President until 2008,[12] only to later resume the role which he shared alongside Graham Taylor until Taylors death.   Watford Rovers was formed in 1881 by Henry Groverand, who went on to play for the club as a full-back.[13][14] Rovers, originally composed entirely of amateur players, held home games at several locations in the town of Watford.[14][15] The team first competed in the FA Cup in the 188687 season, and in 1889 Watford won the County Cup for the first time. The team became the football section of West Hertfordshire Sports Club in 1890, and consequently moved to a ground on Cassio Road. Renamed as West Hertfordshire in 1893, Rovers joined the Southern Football League in 1896, and started to pay professional footballers in 1897. West Hertfordshire merged with local rivals Watford St. Marys in 1898; the merged team was named Watford Football Club.[15] Following relegation to the Southern League Second Division in 1903, Watford appointed its first manager  former England international and First Division top scorer John Goodall. He led Watford to promotion, and kept the team in the division until his departure in 1910.[16] Despite financial constraints, Watford won the Southern League title in the 191415 season under his successor, Harry Kent. Watford held the title for five years following the suspension of the Southern League during the First World War  after finishing the 191920 season runners-up on goal average, the club resigned from the Southern League to join the new Football League Third Division.[17] From 192122, the third tier of The Football League consisted of two parallel sections of 22 clubs, fighting both for promotion to the Second Division and also battling to hold on to their league status.[8] There was a re-election system in place which meant the bottom two teams in each of the two divisions had to apply for re-election to the league.[18] Watford finished outside the top six league positions in every season between 1922 and 1934. Following Kents departure in 1926, they finished 21st out of 22 clubs in 192627, but were unanimously re-elected to the league after a ballot of clubs in the top two divisions of The Football League.[19] By contrast, under Neil McBain and subsequently Bill Findlay, the team recorded five consecutive top six finishes between 193435 and 193839, and won the Football League Third Division South Cup in 1937.[20] The Football League was suspended in 1939 due to the Second World War. Football resumed in 1946, with Watford still in the Third Division South. A 23rd-placed finish in 195051 meant that the club had to apply for re-election to the league once more, but again teams in the First and Second Divisions unanimously voted for Watford to stay in the league.[21] McBain returned in 1956,[16] and the team remained in the division until 1958; the league was restructured into four national divisions for the 195859 season, and Watford were placed in the Fourth Division. Ron Burgess replaced McBain during that season, and in the following campaign Burgess presided over Watfords first Football League promotion. This team included Fourth Division top scorer Cliff Holton,[22] who scored a club record 42 league goals in the season.[23] Holton was sold to Northampton the following year after another 34 goals, to the anger of supporters.[24] Burgess was succeeded by Bill McGarry, who bought new players such as Charlie Livesey and Ron Saunders, and in his only season at the club led the club to what was at the time its highest ever league position: third in the Third Division.[25] Eighteen-year-old Northern Irish goalkeeper Pat Jennings also featured under McGarry, and made his international debut despite being a Third Division player.[26] McGarry joined Ipswich in 1964, and was replaced by player-manager Ken Furphy, from Workington[25] Furphy rebuilt the team around players such as Keith Eddy and Dennis Bond, but after holding Liverpool to a draw in the FA Cup and narrowly failing to win promotion in 196667, Bond was sold to Tottenham Hotspur for 30,000, Watfords record transfer receipt at the time.[27] Furphys rebuilding came to fruition in 1969 with the signing of Barry Endean, whose arrival marked the start of an unbeaten run after Christmas.[28] Watford secured the Third Division title in April, at home to Plymouth Argyle. A year later Watford reached the FA Cup semi-final for the first time, defeating First Division teams Stoke City and Liverpool along the way.[29] Hampered by a lack of funds, however, Furphy eventually joined Blackburn Rovers, to be succeeded by George Kirby. Forced to sell players to survive, Watford fell back into the Third Division in 1972. The team continued to struggle in the third tier, and despite a managerial change, Watford were relegated again in 1975.[16][30] Lifelong Watford supporter Elton John became club chairman in 1976. The singer declared an ambition to take the team into the First Division, and sacked Kirbys successor Mike Keen in April 1977.[31] When Graham Taylor was named as Keens successor, the club was still in the Fourth Division.[32] Taylor achieved promotion in his first season; Watford won the Fourth Division title, recording the most wins, fewest defeats, most goals scored and fewest goals conceded of any side in the division.[33] Promotion to the Second Division followed in 197879, and Ross Jenkins finished the season as the leagues top scorer with 29 goals. Watford consolidated with 18th and 9th-placed finishes over the following two seasons, and secured promotion to the First Division for the first time in 198182, finishing second behind rivals Luton Town.[32][34] Watford started the 198283 season with four league wins from the opening five fixtures; in the space of seven years, the club had climbed from bottom place in the lowest division of The Football League to top position in the highest division.[35][36] Watford were unable to maintain a title challenge, but eventually finished the season second behind Liverpool, which ensured UEFA Cup qualification for the following season. Luther Blissett finished the season as the First Division top scorer, before signing for Italian Serie A side Milan for 1million at the end of the season.[37] An FA Cup Final appearance followed in the 1984 fixture, where they lost to Everton.[7] After guiding Watford to a ninth-place finish in 198687, Taylor left the club to manage Aston Villa.[32] Following Taylors departure, Wimbledon manager Dave Bassett was appointed as his replacement, and England winger John Barnes was sold to Liverpool. After 4 wins from his opening 23 league fixtures, Bassett was sacked in January 1988. Watford were bottom of the First Division at the time of his departure, and Steve Harrison could not prevent relegation at the end of the season. In 198889, Harrisons Watford failed to return to the First Division, after defeat in the Second Division play-offs. The under-18 team won the FA Youth Cup, beating Manchester City 21 after extra time,[38] with future England international David James in goal for the Hornets. Harrison departed in 1990, and over the next few years, the closest Watford came to promotion was a seventh-placed finish in Division One[b] in the 199495 season.[40] However, in the following season  Glenn Roeders third as manager  Watford struggled. Despite the return of Graham Taylor as caretaker manager in February 1996, the club was relegated to Division Two.[16][32] Following the relegation, Taylor became Director of Football, with former Watford midfielder Kenny Jackett as manager. After a mid-table finish in Division Two in 199697, Jackett was demoted to the position of assistant manager. Taylor returned as manager, and won the Second Division title in 199798  Watfords second league title under his management. A second successive promotion followed in 199899, thanks to a 20 play-off final victory over Bolton Wanderers. Watfords first Premiership season started with an early victory over Liverpool, but Watfords form soon faded, and the club was relegated after finishing bottom. Graham Taylor retired at the end of the 200001 season,[32] and was replaced by Gianluca Vialli.[41] Wage bills at the club rose by 4million during Viallis tenure, and the club finished 14th in the division in 200102. Vialli was sacked at the end of the season, following a dispute with the clubs board over the wage bill.[42][43] He was replaced by Ray Lewington, who had joined the club the previous summer as Viallis reserve team manager.[44] Watfords weak financial position was exposed in 200203, following the collapse of ITV Digital.[45][46] The club was facing administration, but an agreement by players and staff to a 12 wage deferral helped the clubs cash flow, and a run to the FA Cup semi-final generated vital revenue.[47][48] Financial constraints saw a large number of players released that summer. After consolidating in 200304, the following season started well, with the club in the upper half of the Championship at the end of September. Poor form, however, saw the club drop towards the relegation zone. Despite reaching the semi-final of the League Cup, Watfords league form did not improve, and Lewington was sacked in March 2005.[49] His successor, Aidy Boothroyd,[50] led the club to Championship survival.[40] Watford finished third in the league in Boothroyds first full season,[40] and defeated Leeds United 30 in the play-off final to gain promotion to the Premier League.[51] But the team did not record a Premier League win until November, and Ashley Young was sold to Aston Villa for a club record fee of 9.65million in January 2007.[23][52] Watford finished bottom after only winning five league games,[40] but did reach the semi-finals of the FA Cup.[53] Boothroyd continued as manager, and spent heavily on players, including a then-club record 3.25 million for Nathan Ellington.[54] Watford led the Championship by several points early in 200708, but only finished sixth;[40] Boothroyds team were defeated 61 on aggregate by Hull City in the play-off semi-finals.[55] Boothroyd left the club by mutual consent three months into the 200809 season, with Watford 21st in the Championship table.[50] Under Boothroyds successor, Brendan Rodgers, Watford finished 13th. Rodgers left to manage Reading at the end of the season;[56] Malky Mackay, who had previously served as caretaker manager, was his replacement.[57] Amid the departures of several key players during Mackays tenure, including Tommy Smith and Jay DeMerit, and the club coming close to administration,[58] Watford finished 16th in 200910 and 14th the following season.[59] Mackay left to manage Cardiff City in June 2011 and was replaced by Sean Dyche.[60] Despite presiding over Watfords highest league position in four years, Dyche was dismissed as Watford manager in July 2012.[61] He was replaced by former Italy international Gianfranco Zola following the Pozzo familys purchase of the club.[62] Following a successful 201213 season which saw a league-best 85 goals scored, Watford ultimately finished third in the Championship, narrowly missing out on an automatic promotion place by two points, behind Hull. In the promotion play-off semi-final, Watford were defeated by Leicester City 10 in the away leg, but won 31 at home, with Troy Deeney scoring the winning goal on a last-second injury time attack following a Leicester penalty kick miss to advance to the final. Watford were defeated in the final by Crystal Palace, 10, on an extra-time penalty by Kevin Phillips. Watford went into the 201314 season full of confidence. They started the season well with positive results, including a 61 win over Bournemouth FC and then a 51 win over Barnsley. The clubs form, however, soon dipped, and Watford struggled, losing five consecutive home matches. This lack of form ultimately led to Gianfranco Zolas departure from the club. In December 2013, Watford appointed Beppe Sannino as their new manager and finished the 201314 season in 13th place. Despite winning four of the first five league games of the 201415 season, Sanninos future at Watford was subject to much speculation after it emerged some players were unhappy with his management style. Sannino resigned from his position as Watford manager on 31 August 2014 with the club second in the table, despite winning 42 at home to Huddersfield Town the previous day.[63] Two days later, on 2 September 2014, Watford confirmed the appointment of former Brighton & Hove Albion head coach scar Garca as the clubs new manager and the successor to Sannino, beating off competition from fellow Championship side Leeds United for his services. Garca, however, resigned from his position as Watford manager on 29 September 2014 for health reasons, having been admitted to hospital with chest pains after the game against Charlton Athletic. Billy McKinlay, who had only been appointed first team coach on 26 September 2014, was appointed as his immediate successor on the same day  his first position in management after spells as a coach with Fulham, and as assistant manager with Northern Ireland.[64] However, on 7 October 2014, McKinlay was replaced as Watford head coach by ex-Chelsea defensive-midfielder Slavia Jokanovi. On 25 April 2015, Watford gained promotion to the Premier League after defeating Brighton 20 and other results going their way.[65] Unfortunately for the Hornets, however, they failed to win their final game of the season against Sheffield Wednesday, thus gifting the Championship title to AFC Bournemouth in a dramatic season finale.[66] Slavia Jokanovi left Watford at the end of his one-year contract after he, and the club, failed to reach new contractual agreements; he was replaced in June 2015 by the Spaniard Quique Snchez Flores.[67] Watfords first fixture in their return to the Premier League was a 22 draw with Everton.[68] In the 201516 season, Watford reached the semi-finals of the FA Cup with a goal by midfielder Adlne Guedioura against Arsenal at Emirates Stadium, ending Arsenals bid to win the competition for three successive times,[69] and finished 13th in the Premier League, despite the club being, when the season began, a favorite among betting shops to be relegated.[70][71] Sanchez was sacked in May 2016, a decision that Flores subsequently attributed to the difference between how the owners and himself assessed Watfords ongoing season,[70] and replaced by Italian coach Walter Mazzarri.[72] On 25 October 2016, the Daily Telegraph claimed it had obtained a forged letter from a bank, submitted when Gino Pozzo became club owner, showing that the holding company which owns Watfords shares, Hornets Investment Ltd, had enough money to be issued the bank guarantee required to allow Pozzo to take control of the club. The English Football League initiated a formal investigation into the finances of the club for allegedly supplying false financial information, while Watford announced they were commencing an internal investigation.[73] On 2 November 2016, Watford chairman Raffaele Riva resigned in order, as he stated, to focus on his other business interests.[74] Watfords kit has changed considerably over the course of the clubs history. The clubs kit featured various combinations of red, green and yellow stripes, before a new colour scheme of black and white was adopted for the 190910 season. These colours were retained until the 1920s, when the club introduced an all-blue shirt. After a change of colours to gold shirts and black shorts for 195960, the teams nickname was changed to The Hornets, after a popular vote via the supporters club. These colours remained until 1976, when Watfords kits started featuring red, and the gold was changed to yellow. That colour scheme has continued into the 21st century.[6] Watfords initial nickname was The Brewers, in reference to the Benskins Brewery, which owned the freehold of Vicarage Road.[75] This nickname did not prove particularly popular, and upon the adoption of a blue-and-white colour scheme in the 1920s, the club became predominantly known as The Blues. When Watford changed kit colours in 1959, supporters chose The Hornets as the teams new nickname, and the club later introduced a crest depicting a hornet.[6] In 1974 the design was changed to depict Harry the Hornet, the clubs mascot.[6][76] The clubs nickname remains, but in 1978 the hornet crest was replaced by a depiction of a hart  a male red elk  on a yellow and black background. A hart represents the towns location in the county of Hertfordshire. Until Barnet[c] and, later, Stevenage joined the Football League, Watford were Hertfordshires only league club.[79] Other nicknames have since been adopted, including The Golden Boys,[80] Yellow Army[81] and The Orns.[82] When Watford play at Vicarage Road their players traditionally enter the pitch at the start of the game to the Z-Cars theme tune.[83] Watford Rovers played at several grounds in the late 19th century, including Cassiobury Park, Vicarage Meadow and Market Street, Watford. In 1890, the team moved to a site on Cassio Road, and remained there for 32 years, before moving to Watfords current stadium at nearby Vicarage Road.[15] The new stadium was initially owned by Benskins Brewery; the club rented the ground until 2001, when it purchased the freehold outright. However, the clubs financial situation worsened following the purchase, and in 2002 Watford sold the ground for 6 million in a deal which entitled Watford to buy the stadium back for 7 million in future. Watford took up this option in 2004 using a campaign backed and funded by the fans called Lets buy back the Vic.[84] Vicarage Road is a four-sided ground with a capacity of 21,977.[85] The East Stand, part of which was constructed in 1922, was closed to the general public in 2008 for health and safety reasons, although it still hosted the dressing rooms and the matchday press area.[86] In November 2013, the East Stand was demolished and in its place a new steel-framed, 3,500-seater stand was constructed. The stand opened fully on Boxing Day 2014 and was named The Elton John Stand after the clubs long standing chairman.[87] The Graham Taylor Stand[88] (previously the Rous Stand), built in 1986, has two tiers and runs the length of the pitch, with the upper section containing the clubs corporate hospitality. At either end of the pitch, The Vicarage Stand is split between the clubs family section and away supporters, while the Rookery Stand is for home supporters only. Both stands were built in the 1990s, financed by proceeds from player sales.[89][90] In the summer of 2015, The Elton John Stand was revamped in order to accommodate an extra 700 seats.[91] This number was revised a day later to around 1,000 extra seats following the announcement of an expansion in the north-east corner.[85] Between 1997 and early 2013, Watford shared Vicarage Road with rugby union side Saracens F.C.[92][93] The stadium has hosted matches for the England under-21s,[94] and senior international football between overseas teams.[95] Elton John has also used Vicarage Road as a venue for concerts: He first played at the stadium in 1974 and returned in 2005 and 2010 to stage fundraising concerts for the club.[96] Former events include horse and carriage shows[14] and greyhound racing.[97] Watford fans maintain a rivalry with those of Luton Town. The two sides met regularly in the Southern League between 1900 and 1920,[98] and continued to do so in The Football League until 1937,[99] when Luton gained promotion from Division Three South. Luton remained in a higher division than Watford until 1963.[100] Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, Watford and Luton met sporadically. Despite this, the rivalry grew in significance, particularly following an ill-tempered match between the sides in 1969, in which three players were sent off.[100] Both sides won promotion to the First Division in the 198182 season, with Luton taking the championship ahead of Watford.[34] They were also relegated together from the new Division 1 in 199596, with Watford finishing 23rd ahead of bottom-placed Luton.[101][b] Watfords promotion from Division 2 in 199798 meant that the two sides did not meet again until Luton won promotion to the Championship for the 200506 season.[b] The only meeting between those seasons  a League Cup tie in the 200203 season  was marred by violence inside Vicarage Road.[102] On 2 January 2006, Watford won 21 at Kenilworth Road in the Championship. A 11 draw in the most recent match between the sides, on 9 April 2006, secured Watfords place in the 2006 Championship play-offs, from which they eventually won promotion to the Premier League for the second time beating, Leeds United 30 at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff.[103] Watford have played in a higher division than Luton in every season since 200607, a nine-season span.[40][104] The head-to-head record between the clubs in competitions which currently exist stands at Luton 39 wins, Watford 27 wins, with 23 draws.[d] Watford have remained the higher ranked team at the end of every season since 1997 (and for 25 of the last 26 seasons, with only 199697 seeing Luton finish higher in the league than Watford).

Watfords team was selected by committee until 1903, when former England international John Goodall was appointed player-manager. The impact was immediate, as Watford secured promotion to the Southern League First Division in 190304. Goodall retired as a player in 1907, and left the club in 1910. He was replaced by his former captain, Harry Kent, who become known for his financial management of the club; under Kent, Watford frequently made a profit in the transfer market.[107] Kent led the club to the Southern League title in 191415, and missed out on a second title in 191920 on goal average, before resigning in 1926. His three immediate successors  Fred Pagnam, Neil McBain and Bill Findlay  all played for Watford before and during the early part of their managerial tenures. None were able to lead the team to promotion from the Third Division South, although Findlay did lead Watford to a Third Division South Cup win in 1937. Up until Findlays departure in 1947, Watford had been managed by five managers in 44 years, all of whom played for the team. By contrast, six men managed the club between 1947 and 1956, only two of whom were former Watford players.[16] After a further three years under McBain between 1956 and 1959, Watfords following three managers presided over improved teams. Ron Burgess led Watford to promotion from the Fourth Division in 195960. Bill McGarry was only in charge for one full season (196364), but Watford recorded a finish of third in the Third Division, the clubs highest Football League finish until that point. His successor Ken Furphy matched that achievement in 196667, and led Watford to the Third Division title in 1969, before taking the club to its first FA Cup semi-final in 1970. Following Furphys departure in 1971, Watford entered a period of decline, experiencing relegation under subsequent managers George Kirby and Mike Keen.[16] Graham Taylor took charge of Watford in 1977. He led the club to promotion to the Third Division in 1978, the Second Division in 1979, and the First Division for the first time in Watfords history in 1982. After a second-placed finish in the First Division in 1983, Watford competed in European competition for the first time in 198384, as well as reaching the 1984 FA Cup final. Taylor left the club at the end of 198687. Under the six subsequent permanent managers (Dave Bassett, Steve Harrison, Colin Lee, Steve Perryman, Glenn Roeder and Kenny Jackett), Watford slid from 9th in the top tier in 1987, to 13th in the third tier in 1997. Taylor returned as manager for the start of the 199798 season. He led the club to consecutive promotions, but could not prevent relegation from the Premier League in 19992000. Since Taylors retirement in 2001, Watford have had twelve managers. Of these, Aidy Boothroyd took Watford back to the Premier League in 2006, but Watford were relegated in 2007, and Boothroyd departed in 2008.[108] Following Watfords takeover by the Pozzo family, Gianfranco Zola was appointed head coach, replacing former centre back Sean Dyche in July 2012,.[59] Zola took Watford to third position in the Championship in 201213 but resigned on 16 December 2013. He was replaced by fellow Italian Beppe Sannino in December 2013. Sannino guided the team to a final league position of 13th. Despite winning four of the first five league matches of the 2014/15 season, and with Watford sitting in 2nd place, Sanninos position had become the subject of much speculation following rumours of dressing-room unrest and some players taking a dislike to his style of management. Sannino resigned from his position as head coach on 31 August 2014 after just over eight months in charge. His final game in charge was a 42 win at home to Huddersfield Town the day before. Sanninos departure initiated a bizarre sequence of events which led to Watford having three further head coaches in little more than a month. On 2 September, Watford confirmed the appointment of former Brighton & Hove Albion head coach scar Garca as the successor to Sannino, beating off competition from fellow Championship side Leeds United for his services. Garca, however, resigned from his position on 29 September 2014 for health reasons, having been admitted to hospital with chest pains a couple of weeks prior. Billy McKinlay, who had only been appointed first team coach on 26 September 2014, was appointed as his immediate successor on the same day  his first position in management.[64] A week later, McKinlay was released by mutual consent and former Partizan coach Slavia Jokanovi appointed in his place, apparently because the club favoured a head coach with greater experience.[109] On 4 June 2015, Quique Snchez Flores was announced as the new head coach as the replacement to Jovanovi,[110] who had failed to agree contract terms. Despite going on to lead the newly promoted Watford to a comfortable mid-table position in the Premier League and the semi-final of the FA Cup, it was announced on 13 May 2016 that Snchez Flores would be leaving the club at the end of the season.[111] Following Sanchez Floress departure, Walter Mazzarri was announced as Watfords head coach starting on 1 July 2016. [112] Mazzaris tenure as manager was terminated at the end of the season. On 27th May 2017 Marco Silva was appointed Head Coach.[113] Striker Luther Blissett holds the record for Watford appearances, having played 503 matches in all competitions between 1976 and 1992, and his 415 appearances in The Football League during the same period is also a club record. Blissett holds the corresponding goalscoring records, with 186 career Watford goals, 148 of which were in the league. The records for the most league goals in a season is held by Cliff Holton, having scored 42 goals in the 195960 season. The highest number of goals scored by a player in a single game at a professional level is the six registered by Harry Barton against Wycombe Wanderers in September 1903.[23] Watfords biggest ever competitive win came in 1900, when the team defeated Maidenhead 110 in the Southern League Second Division.[23] The teams biggest Football League winning margin is 80; this first occurred in a Third Division South match against Newport County in 1924, and was repeated in a First Division match against Sunderland in 1982. Both of these matches were at home  Watford have won an away league match by five goals on six occasions, most recently in the 61 win against Leeds United at Elland Road in 2012. The most goals scored in a Football League game involving Watford is 11, in Watfords 74 victories against Swindon Town, Torquay United and Burnley in 1934, 1937 and 2003 respectively.[114] The clubs highest home attendance is 34,099, for a fourth round FA Cup match against Manchester United on 3 February 1969. The record home league attendance is 27,968 against Queens Park Rangers in August of the same year.[23] Watfords home capacity has since been reduced due to all-seater requirements; it currently stands at 21,577.[115]

The club was formed in 1878 and has played at its home ground, The Hawthorns, since 1900. Albion were one of the founding members of the Football League in 1888 and have spent the majority of their existence in the top tier of English football. They have been champions of England once, in 191920 and have been runners-up twice but they have had more success in the FA Cup, winning it five times. The first came in 1888, the year the league was founded, and the most recent in 1968, their last major trophy. They also won the Football League Cup at the first attempt in 1966. The clubs longest consecutive period in the top division spanned twenty-four years between 1949 and 1973, and from 1986 to 2002 they spent their longest ever spell out of the top division. They currently play in the Premier League. The team has played in navy blue and white stripes for most of the clubs history; and the club badge features a throstle perched on a hawthorn branch. Albion have a number of long-standing rivalries with other West Midlands clubs; their traditional rivals have always been Aston Villa and Wolverhampton Wanderers, the latter of whom they contest with in the Black Country derby.   The club was founded as West Bromwich Strollers in 1878 by workers from George Salters Spring Works in West Bromwich, in Staffordshire.[A][2] They were renamed West Bromwich Albion in 1880, becoming the first team to adopt the Albion suffix; Albion was a district of West Bromwich where some of the players lived or worked, close to what is today Greets Green.[2] The club joined the Birmingham & District Football Association in 1881 and became eligible for their first competition, the Birmingham Cup. They reached the quarter-finals, beating several longer-established clubs on the way. In 1883, Albion won their first trophy, the Staffordshire Cup. Albion joined the Football Association in the same year; this enabled them to enter the FA Cup for the first time in the 188384 season.[3] In 1885 the club turned professional,[4] and in 1886 they reached the FA Cup final for the first time, losing 20 to Blackburn Rovers in a replay. They reached the final again in 1887, but lost 20 to Aston Villa. In 1888 the team won the trophy for the first time, beating strong favourites Preston North End 21 in the final.[5] As FA Cup winners, they qualified to play in a Football World Championship game against Scottish Cup winners Renton, which ended in a 41 defeat.[6] In March 1888, William McGregor wrote to what he considered to be the top five English teams, including Albion, informing them of his intention to form an association of clubs that would play each other home and away each season. Thus when the Football League started later that year, Albion became one of the twelve founder members.[7] Albions second FA Cup success came in 1892, beating Aston Villa 30. They met Villa again in the 1895 final, but lost 10. The team suffered relegation to Division Two in 190001, their first season at The Hawthorns.[8] They were promoted as champions the following season but relegated again in 190304.[9] The club won the Division Two championship once more in 191011, and the following season reached another FA Cup Final, where they were defeated by Second Division Barnsley in a replay.[10] Albion won the Football League title in 191920 for the only time in their history following the end of World War I, their totals of 104 goals and 60 points both breaking the previous league records.[11] The team finished as Division One runners-up in 192425, narrowly losing out to Huddersfield Town, but were relegated in 192627.[12] In 193031, they won promotion as well as the FA Cup, beating Birmingham 21 in the final.[13] The Double of winning the FA Cup and promotion has not been achieved before or since.[14] Albion reached the final again in 1935, losing to Sheffield Wednesday, but were relegated three years later.[15] They gained promotion in 194849,[16] and there followed the clubs longest unbroken spell in the top flight of English football, a total of 24 years.[17][18] In 195354, Albion came close to being the first team in the 20th century to win the League and Cup double. They succeeded in winning the FA Cup, beating Preston North End 32, but injuries and a loss of form towards the end of the season meant that they finished as runners-up to fierce rivals Wolverhampton Wanderers in the league.[19] Nonetheless, Albion became known for their brand of fluent, attacking football, with the 195354 side being hailed as the Team of the Century. One national newspaper went so far as to suggest that the team be chosen en masse to represent England at the 1954 FIFA World Cup finals.[20] They remained one of the top English sides for the remainder of the decade, reaching the semi-final of the 1957 FA Cup and achieving three consecutive top five finishes in Division One between 195758 and 195960. Although their league form was less impressive during the 1960s, the second half of the decade saw West Brom establish a reputation as a successful cup side. In 1966, under manager Jimmy Hagan, they beat West Ham United in their first League Cup appearance, winning 53 on aggregate in the last two-legged final. The following year they reached the final again, the first at Wembley, but lost 32 to Third Division Queens Park Rangers after being 20 up at half-time.[21] Albions cup form continued under Hagans successor Alan Ashman. He guided the club to their last major trophy to date, the 1968 FA Cup, when they beat Everton in extra time thanks to a single goal from Jeff Astle.[22] Albion reached the FA Cup semi-final and European Cup Winners Cup quarter-final in 1969, and were defeated 21 by Manchester City in the 1970 League Cup Final.[23] The club were less successful during the reign of Don Howe, and were relegated to Division Two at the end of 197273,[24] but gained promotion three years later under the guidance of player-manager Johnny Giles.[25] Under Ron Atkinson, Albion reached the 1978 FA Cup semi-final but lost to Ipswich Town.[26] In May of that year, Albion became the first English professional team to play in China, going unbeaten on their five-game trip.[27][28] In 197879, the team finished third in Division One, their highest placing for over 20 years, and also reached the UEFA Cup quarter-final, where they were defeated by Red Star Belgrade.[29] The team around this time was notable for simultaneously fielding three black players: Cyrille Regis, Laurie Cunningham and Brendon Batson; and is considered to be an integral part of the acceptance of black footballers in the English leagues. In his second spell as manager, Ronnie Allen guided the team to both domestic cup semi-finals in 198182.[30] The mid-1980s saw the start of Albions longest and deepest decline. They were relegated in 198586 with the worst record in the clubs history,[31] beginning a period of sixteen years outside the top flight. Five years later, the club were relegated to the Third Division for the first and only time.[32] Albion had spent the majority of their history in the top-flight of English football, but when the FA Premier League was founded in 1992 the club found themselves in the third tier, which had been renamed Division Two. In 199293, Albion finished fourth and entered the playoffs for the first time, having just missed out the previous year. Albions first appearance at Wembley for over 20 years  and their last ever at the original stadium  saw them beat Port Vale 30 to return to the second level  now renamed the First Division.[33] Manager Ossie Ardiles then joined Tottenham Hotspur, however, and a succession of managers over the next few seasons saw Albion consolidate their Division One status without ever mounting a serious promotion challenge. The appointment of Gary Megson in March 2000 heralded an upturn in the clubs fortunes. Megson guided Albion to Division One safety in 19992000, and to the play-offs a year later. He went on to lead the club to promotion to the Premier League in 200102.[34] After being relegated in their first Premier League season,[35] they made an immediate return to the top flight in 200304.[36] In 200405, Megsons successor, former Albion midfielder Bryan Robson, led the team to a last-day Great Escape, when Albion became the first Premier League club to avoid relegation having been bottom of the table at Christmas.[37] This feat was repeated by Sunderland in the 201314 season and Leicester the following year, but West Brom remain the only team to also have been bottom during the final day of the season. Despite this success, they failed to avoid the drop the following season,[38] and Robson was replaced by Tony Mowbray in October 2006.[39] The club competed in the Championship promotion playoff final at Wembley Stadium on 28 May 2007, but lost 10 to Derby County.[40] The following season, Mowbray led the Baggies to Wembley again, this time in the semi-finals of the FA Cup, where they lost 10 to Portsmouth.[41] One month later, Albion were promoted to the Premier League as winners of the Championship,[42] but were relegated at the end of the 200809 campaign.[43] Mowbray left the club to manage Celtic and was replaced by Roberto Di Matteo,[44] who led the club back to the Premier League at the first attempt,[45] but was dismissed in February 2011 and replaced by Roy Hodgson.[46] May 2012 saw Roy Hodgson, having led West Brom to a tenth-place finish in his first season, leave to become the manager of the England national team. Steve Clarke then led Albion to an eighth-place finish in 201213, their highest in the Premier League, but was sacked halfway through the following season[47] and replaced by Pepe Mel,[48] who left by mutual consent at the end of the campaign. After the brief tenure of Alan Irvine,[49] Tony Pulis was appointed head coach on 1 January 2015.[50][51] On 5 August 2016, it was announced the club had been sold to a Chinese investment club headed up by Guochuan Lai, and John Williams replaced Peace as chairman.[52]  West Brom have played in navy blue and white striped shirts for the majority of their existence, usually with white shorts and white socks. The team is occasionally referred to as the Stripes by supporters.[53] A number of different colours were trialled during the clubs formative years however, including cardinal red and blue quarters in 188081, yellow and white quarters in 188182, chocolate and blue halves in 188182 and 188283, red and white hoops in 188283, chocolate and white in 188384 and cardinal red and blue halves in 188485.[54] The blue and white stripes made their first appearance in the 188586 season, although at that time they were of a lighter shade of blue; the navy blue stripes did not appear until after the First World War.[55] For the regional leagues played during the Second World War, Albion were forced to switch to all-blue shirts, as rationing meant that striped material was considered a luxury.[56] Like all football clubs, Albion sport a secondary or change strip when playing away from home against a team whose colours clash with their own. As long ago as the 1890s, and throughout much of the clubs early history, a change strip of white jerseys with black shorts was worn.[57] The away shirt additionally featured a large V during the First World War.[58] In the 1935 FA Cup Final, however, when both of Albion and Sheffield Wednesdays kits clashed, a switch was made to plain navy blue shirts. An all-red strip was adopted at the end of the 1950s, but was dropped following defeat in the 1967 League Cup Final, to be replaced by the all-white design that was worn during the clubs FA Cup run of 196768.[57] Since then the away strip has changed regularly, with yellow and green stripes the most common of a number of different designs used. In the 1990s and 2000s a third kit has occasionally been introduced.[59] Albion players  along with those of other Football League teams  first wore numbers on the back of their shirts in the abandoned season of 193940,[60] and names on the back of their shirts from 19992000.[61] Red numbers were added to the side of Albion players shorts in 1969.[57] BSR Housewares became the clubs first shirt sponsor during the 198182 season.[55] The clubs shirts have been sponsored for the majority of the time since then, although there was no shirt sponsor at the end of the 199394 season, after local solicitors Coucher & Shaw were closed down by the Law Society of England and Wales.[62] Unusually for a Premier League club, Albion were again without a shirt sponsor for the start of the 200809 campaign, as negotiations with a new sponsor were still ongoing when the season began.[63] The longest-running shirt sponsorship deal agreed by the club ran for seven seasons between 1997 and 2004 with the West Bromwich Building Society.[55][64] Other sponsors have included T-Mobile (200408), Homeserve (201011), Bodog (201112), Zoopla (201214), Intuit Quickbooks (201415), TLCBET (201516) and UK-K8 (2016present). Since May 2011, West Broms kit has been manufactured by Adidas, who are contracted until 2016.[65] Previous manufacturers have included Diadora (19972006) and Umbro (200611). Albions main club badge dates back to the late 1880s, when club secretary Tom Smith suggested that a throstle (song thrush) sitting on a crossbar be adopted for the badge.[66][B] Since then, the club badge has always featured a throstle, usually on a blue and white striped shield, although the crossbar was replaced with a hawthorn branch at some point after the clubs move to the Hawthorns. The throstle was chosen because the public house in which the team used to change kept a pet thrush in a cage. It also gave rise to Albions early nickname, the Throstles. As late as the 1930s, a caged throstle was placed beside the touchline during matches and it was said that it only used to sing if Albion were winning.[66] In 1979, an effigy of a throstle was erected above the half-time scoreboard of the Woodman corner at the Hawthorns,[67] and was returned to the same area of the ground following redevelopment in the early 2000s.[68] In 1975, a version of the badge (on a roundel rather than a shield) was granted by the College of Arms to the Football League for licensing to the club. The badge was described in heraldic blazon as, On a roundel paly of thirteen argent and azure a missel thrush perched on a raspberry branch leaved and fructed proper. This is the only known occasion on which the branch has been described as a raspberry branch rather than a hawthorn branch: Rodney Dennys, the officer of arms responsible, may have been imperfectly briefed.[69] The badge has been subject to various revisions through the years, meaning that the club was unable to register it as a trademark. As a result of this, the badge was re-designed in 2006, incorporating the name of the club for the first time. The new badge gave Albion the legal protection they sought.[70] The main club badge should be distinguished from the badge displayed on the first team strip, as the two have rarely coincided. No badge appeared on the kit for most of the clubs history, although the Stafford knot featured on the team jerseys for part of the 1880s.[71] The West Bromwich town arms were worn on the players shirts for the 1931, 1935 and 1954 FA Cup finals. The towns Latin motto, Labor omnia vincit, translates as labour conquers all things or work conquers all. The town arms were revived as the shirt badge from 1994 until 2000,[C] with the throstle moved to the collar of the shirts. Albions first regular shirt badge appeared in the late 1960s and early 1970s where it was blue. Although it featured the throstle, it did not include the blue and white striped shield of the club badge.[55] A similar design was also used during the late 1980s and early 1990s. In the mid-1970s, a more abstract version of the throstle was used on the clubs shirts, while in the late 1970s through to the mid-1980s, an embroidered WBA logo was displayed, a common abbreviation of the clubs name in print.[55] Not until the early 21st century did the full club badge appear on the teams shirts.[55] The speed with which the club became established following its foundation is illustrated by the fact that it outgrew four successive grounds in its first seven years. The first was Coopers Hill, where they played from 1878 to 1879. From 1879 to 1881, they appear to have alternated between Coopers Hill and Dartmouth Park.[72] During the 188182 season, they played at Bunns Field, also known as the Birches. This had a capacity of between 1,500 and 2,000,[73] and was Albions first enclosed ground, allowing the club to charge an entrance fee for the first time.[71] From 1882 to 1885, as the popularity of football increased, Albion rented the Four Acres ground from the well-established West Bromwich Dartmouth Cricket Club. But they quickly outgrew this new home and soon needed to move again. From 1885 to 1900, Albion played at Stoney Lane; their tenure of this ground was arguably the most successful period in the clubs history, as they won the FA Cup twice and were runners-up three times. By 1900, when the lease on Stoney Lane expired, the club needed a bigger ground yet again and so made its last move to date. All of Albions previous grounds had been close to the centre of West Bromwich, but on this occasion they took up a site on the towns border with Handsworth and Smethwick. The new ground was named The Hawthorns, after the hawthorn bushes that covered the area and were cleared to make way for it.[74] Albion drew 11 with Derby County in the first match at the stadium, on 3 September 1900.[75] The record attendance at the Hawthorns was on 6 March 1937, when 64,815 spectators saw Albion beat Arsenal 31 in the FA Cup quarter-final.[76] The Hawthorns became an all-seater stadium in the 1990s, in order to comply with the recommendations of the Taylor Report.[77] Its capacity today is 26,850,[77] the four stands being known respectively as the Birmingham Road End, Smethwick End, East Stand and West Stand.[78] At an altitude of 551feet (168m) above sea level, the Hawthorns is the highest of all the 92 Premier League and Football League grounds.[79] The Hawthorns is certificated under the highest UEFA pitch surfaces which means it is ready to host almost any competition if required, however attendance may scupper this. Its West Stand could be developed over the Halfords Lane road at the back of the stand to allow an upper tier, approximately adding around 5,000 to the capacity of The Hawthorns. Other developments can include the filling in of The Millennium and East-Rainbow corners if and when required. West Bromwich Albion as a football club own many retail outlets around The Hawthorns stadium including its Megastore, its club store in Merry Hill and seasonally a club store for the first time in 2014, in West Bromwich Town Centre. They also own the former Hawthorns Pub, a Grade II listed building behind the West Stand on the corner of Halfords Lane and the Birmingham Road. This was opened against the home fixture against Southampton in September 2015 and serves as the official club fanzone with licensed bars, live music, fan favourites  such as mascots and children activities  as well as being shared with a high street food outlet. The pub is to compete with the famous The Vine pub in Roebuck Lane which a popular destination for all visiting and home football fans year-round. The Lords my Shepherd, Ill not want:\nHe makes me down to lie\nIn pastures green; he leadeth me\nThe quiet waters by. The West Bromwich Albion Supporters Club has branches throughout the United Kingdom, as well as in Ireland, Australia, Malta, Greece (unofficial), Jersey, Northern Ireland, United States (unofficial), India and Thailand.[81] Albions club anthem is The Lords my Shepherd, a setting of Psalm 23.[82] Supporters of the team celebrate goals by bouncing up and down and chanting Boing Boing. This dates back to the 199293 season, when the team was promoted from the new Second Division.[83] The Liquidator instrumental by the Harry J. Allstars has also been popularly used in the stadium since the late 1960s. In recent years fans of the team have celebrated the end of each season by adopting a fancy dress theme for the final away match, including dressing as vikings in 2004 in honour of Player of the Season Thomas Gaardse.[84] In 200203 Albions fans were voted the best in the Premier League by their peers,[85] while in the BBCs 2002 national intelligence test Test the Nation, they were found to be more likely to be smarter than any other football supporters, registering an average score of 138.[86] Famous fans include comedian Frank Skinner, TV presenter Adrian Chiles, One Direction singer Liam Payne, comedian Lenny Henry, actress Julie Walters, actor Matthew Marsden, The Rolling Stones guitarist Ronnie Wood, tennis player Goran Ivanievi, television presenter Cat Deeley, boxer Richie Woodhall and guitarist Eric Clapton.[87] The club has published an official matchday programme for supporters since 1905.[88] The publication was entitled Albion News for many years, but was renamed Albion from the 200203 season until the close season of 2013, when it was renamed back to Albion News.[89] It won Premier League Programme of the Year in 200203 and Third Division Programme of the Year in 199192.[90] In 200708, it was awarded Championship Programme of the Year by both Programme Monthly and the Football Programme Directory.[91] The programme has a circulation in excess of 8,000 copies.[92] The first West Bromwich Albion fanzine, Fingerpost, was published from 1983 until 1992, and was followed by several others, most notably Grorty Dick (19892005) and Last Train to Rolfe Street (19921995). Since Grorty Dick ceased publication in 2005, the club now only has one fanzine dedicated to it; Baggie Shorts which is produced by the West Bromwich Albion Supporters Club London Branch.[93] Although known in their early days as the Throstles, the clubs more popular nickname among supporters came to be the Baggies, a term which the club itself looked down upon for many years but later embraced. The phrase was first heard at the Hawthorns in the 1900s, but its exact origins are uncertain.[94] One suggestion is that the name was bestowed on Albion supporters by their rivals at Aston Villa, because of the large baggy trousers that many Albion fans wore at work to protect themselves from molten iron in the factories and foundries of the Black Country.[95] Club historian Tony Matthews however suggests that it derives from the bagmen, who carried the clubs matchday takings in big leather bags from the turnstiles to the cash office on the halfway line.[96] Other theories relate to the baggy shorts worn by various players during the clubs early years.[94][96] The official club mascots are named Baggie Bird and Albi; both are based on the throstle depicted on the club crest.[97] Historically, Albions greatest rivals have always been Aston Villa from nearby Birmingham. The two clubs contested three FA Cup Finals between 1887 and 1895 (Villa winning two and Albion one). More recently, however, most Albion fans have begun to see Wolverhampton Wanderers as their main rivals, particularly between 1989 and 2002, when Albion and Villa were never in the same division but Albion were in the same division as Wolves for 11 out of 14 seasons. With Albion and Villa being in different divisions for so many years, however, the rivalry became less heated and Aston Villa supporters now consider Birmingham City as their main local rivals and not Albion despite geographical distance between the two clubs. A less-heated rivalry also exists with Birmingham City, with whom Albion contested the 1931 FA Cup final, as well as a semi-final in 1968.[98][99] A number of hooligan firms associate themselves with Albion, including Section 5, Clubhouse and the Smethwick Mob.[100] Albion and Wolves have contested the Black Country derby, it is one of the longest standing derbies in world football, being played more than 150 times; their first major clash was an FA Cup tie in 1886. The rivalry came to prominence when the two clubs contested the league title in 195354, and during the 1990s it intensified to new heights among supporters, with both clubs languishing in Division One for much of the decade and only local pride at stake.[101] Moreover, in 2002 Albion came from being 11 points adrift to overhaul Wolves to gain promotion. The rivalry was further heightened after the sides met in the play-offs in 2007. A 2004 survey by Planetfootball.com confirmed that the majority of both Albion and Wolves supporters consider the other to be their main rival. Despite their geographical location, fellow Black County club Walsall are seen as lesser rivals, having played in a lower division than Albion for most of their history. Ranked by The Daily Telegraph as the most fierce in the region behind the Black Country derby and the Second City derby, games between Aston Villa and West Brom are quite fierce.[102] The two first met on 9 December 1882, in the second round of the Staffordshire Cup: Villa hosted a 33 draw in front of 13,900 fans, while in the replay West Brom won by a single goal with an attendance of 10,500. On 3 January 1885, they met for the first time in the third round of the FA Cup: a goalless draw at West Brom was followed by a 30 victory for them away at Villa.[103] The following year, both teams became founder members of the Football League. They met first in a league fixture on 19 January 1889, Villa winning 20 at home, and again the next week in a 33 draw.[104] The two teams met in two further FA Cup finals in the 19th century, a 30 win for West Brom in 1892 and a 10 win for Aston Villa in 1895.[103] Birmingham City were relegated from the Premier League in 2011 and Wolverhampton Wanderers a season later, leaving Aston Villa and West Brom as the only West Midlands teams in Englands top division and without their respective main rivals[105] and with Albion finishing above their nearest rivals for the second season in a row, the historic rivalry is re-surfacing. At the end of the 201516 season, Aston Villa were relegated, leaving West Brom the only West Midlands team in the top flight for the 201617 season. In the 2000s BBC television drama series New Tricks, the characters Jack Halford, Brian Lane and Gerry Standing were so named by the writer Roy Mitchell in honour of the Halford Lane standing area of Albions ground.[106] The 1960s television documentary programme Look at Britain screened an episode called The Saturday Men focusing on the club[107] Frank Skinner and Paula Wilcox starred in the comedy series Blue Heaven which followed the adventures of an Albion supporter in the 1990s and included scenes from the Hawthorns. Skinner is a real life Albion supporter.[108] The testimonial match of Albion player Len Cantello was the subject of the BBC documentary Whites Vs Blacks: How Football Changed A Nation.[109] In the clubs formative years, West Bromwich Albion were run by a seven-man playing committee, and funded by each member contributing a weekly subscription of 6d (six pence) (2p).[110] Albions first chairman was Henry Jackson, appointed in 1885, with the club becoming a limited company in June 1891.[111] Other early chairmen of Albion included Jem Bayliss and Billy Bassett, both of whom had earlier played for the club. Indeed, from 1878 to 1986 there was always an Albion player or ex-player on the clubs committee or board of directors.[111] Bassett became an Albion director in 1905, following the resignation of the previous board in its entirety. The club was in deep financial trouble and had had a writ served upon them by their bank, but Bassett and returning chairman Harry Keys rescued the club, aided by local fund-raising activities.[112] Bassett became chairman in 1908, and helped the club to avoid bankruptcy once more in 1910 by paying the players summer wages from his own pocket.[113] He remains Albions longest-serving chairman, having held the position until his death in 1937.[114] The clubs longest-serving director was Major H. Wilson Keys, during the period 19301965, including 15 years as chairman. He became the FAs vice-president in 1969.[115] Sir Bert Millichip served as Albion chairman from 1974 to 1983, after which he chose to concentrate on his role as chairman of the Football Association.[116] In 1996, the club became a public limited company, issuing shares to supporters at 500 and 3,000 each.[117] The shares were quoted on the Alternative Investment Market, but the club withdrew from the stock exchange in order to become a private company again in 2004.[118] The name of the company thus reverted from West Bromwich Albion plc to West Bromwich Albion Limited, the latter becoming a subsidiary of West Bromwich Albion Holdings Limited. Jeremy Peace took up the post in 2002, after a rift between previous chairman Paul Thompson and manager Gary Megson forced Thompson to quit the club.[119] In September 2007, Peace acquired additional shares in West Bromwich Albion Holdings Limited, taking his total stake in the company to 50.56. This triggered a requirement, under the Takeover Code, for him to make a mandatory cash offer for the remaining shares in both WBA Holdings Ltd and WBA Ltd.[120] Later that year, Michelle Davies became Albions first female director.[121] She, however, has since stepped down from this position.[122] Jeremy Peace announced in June 2008 that he was looking for a major new investor for the club,[123] but no firm proposals were received by 31 July deadline.[124] On 24 July 2015, Jeremy Peace announced that his sale exclusivity deal was now off after potential buyer was unable to fulfil terms of sale.[125] In July 2016, Peace announced that he had managed to find a buyer in the form of Chinese entrepreneur Guochuan Lai, the figure agreed upon is believed to have been 175million. This take over was successfully completed ahead of schedule on 15 September the same year.[126] Note: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules.

A modern-day, 16-man squad was compiled from the results; all selected players are depicted on a commemorative mural displayed at the Hawthorns. Fourteen of the sixteen players are English-born, with a fifteenth, Cyrille Regis, being a full England international. The list of 16 is as follows:[130] Other notable honours bestowed upon West Brom players include the PFA Young Player of the Year award, which was presented to Cyrille Regis in 1979.[131] In 1998, Billy Bassett and Bryan Robson were named among the list of Football League 100 Legends, along with Arthur Rowley, Geoff Hurst and Johnny Giles.[132] Bryan Robson was also an inaugural inductee into the English Football Hall of Fame in 2002,[133] to be joined two years later by Geoff Hurst.[134] Bobby Robson, a player with Albion, has also been inducted, although this was for his achievements as a manager.[135] In 191920, Fred Morris became the first Albion player to finish as top goalscorer in Division One, a feat which has since been repeated by Ronnie Allen, Derek Kevan, Jeff Astle and Tony Brown.[D][136] Brown, who holds the club records for goals and appearances, was voted into the PFA Centenary Hall of Fame in July 2007.[137] The following managers have all led West Bromwich Albion to at least one of the following achievements while in charge of the club: winning a major trophy or reaching the final, achieving a top three league finish in the top flight, winning promotion or reaching the quarter-finals of a major European competition. West Bromwich Albions record victory was their 120 league win against Darwen on 4 April 1892.[4] This is still the widest margin of victory for a game in the top-flight of English football, although the record was equalled by Nottingham Forest when they beat Leicester Fosse by the same scoreline in 1909.[138] Albions biggest FA Cup victory came when they beat Chatham 101 on 2 March 1889. The clubs record league defeat was a 310 loss against Stoke City on 4 February 1937, while a 05 defeat to Leeds United on 18 February 1967 represents Albions heaviest FA Cup loss.[4] Tony Brown holds a number of Albions club records. He has made the most appearances overall for the club (720), as well as most appearances in the league (574), FA Cup (54) and in European competition (17). Brown is the clubs top scorer in the league (218), the FA Cup (27) and in Europe (8). He is also the clubs record scorer overall, with 279 goals. W. G. Richardson scored 328 goals for the club, but this includes 100 during World War II, which are not normally counted towards competitive totals. Richardson holds the club record for most league goals in a single season, scoring 39 times in 193536.[4][139] Albions most capped international player, taking into account only those caps won while at the club, is Chris Brunt. He has appeared 38 times for Northern Ireland as a West Brom player, earning 48 caps in total.[140][141] Jesse Pennington is the clubs most capped England international, with 25 caps.[142] The highest transfer fee paid by the club is 12million to Zenit Saint Petersburg for Salomn Rondn on 10 August 2015; the deal could rise to over 15million with appearance fee and other add-ons.[143] The record transfer from Albion to another club is that of Curtis Davies to Aston Villa in July 2008 for a fee of 8.5million.[4] [144]

Club (i/sndrlnd/, locally /sndln/) is a professional football club based in the North East city of Sunderland in the larger metropolitan area of Tyne and Wear. From the 2017-18 season, Sunderland will be playing in the EFL Championship, the second tier of English football. Since its formation in 1879,[3] the club has won six top-flight First Division (now the Premier League) titles (1892, 1893, 1895, 1902, 1913, and 1936), a total only bettered by five other clubs, and has finished runners-up five times. The club has also won the FA Cup twice (1937 and 1973) and been runners-up twice (1913 and 1992), as well as winning the FA Community Shield in 1936 and being finalists the following year. Sunderland have also been Football League Cup finalists in 1985 and 2014. Sunderland won their first FA Cup in 1937 with a 31 victory over Preston North End, and remained in the top league for 68 successive seasons until they were relegated for the first time in 1958. Sunderlands most notable trophy after the Second World War was their second FA Cup in 1973, when the club secured a 10 victory over Leeds United. The team has won the second tier title five times in that period and the third tier title once. Sunderland play their home games at the 49,000[4]-capacity all-seater Stadium of Light having moved from Roker Park in 1997. The original ground capacity was 42,000 which was increased to 49,000 following expansion in 2000. Sunderland have a long-standing rivalry with their neighbouring club Newcastle United, with whom they have contested the TyneWear derby since 1898. Since their most recent promotion to the Premier League in 2007, Sunderland have become one of the worlds wealthiest football brands, being valued at USD $93 million in 2014, 31st in the world overall.[5][6]   Founded 17 October 1879 as Sunderland and District Teachers A.F.C. by schoolmaster James Allan, Sunderland joined The Football League for the 189091 season. They replaced Stoke, who had failed to be re-elected, becoming the first new club to join the league since its inauguration in 1888.[7] During the late 19th century, they were declared the Team of All Talents by William McGregor,[8] the founder of the league, after a 72 win against Aston Villa.[8] Sunderland won the league championship in the 189192 season, one season after joining The Football League. The clubs 42 points were five clear of nearest rivals Preston North End, and this performance led The Times to describe the players as a wonderfully fine team.[9] Sunderland successfully defended the title the following season, aided by centre forward Johnny Campbell, who broke the 30-goal mark for the second time in consecutive seasons. In the process, they became the first team to score 100 goals in a season, a feat not matched until 191920, when West Bromwich Albion set a new record.[10] Sunderland came close to winning a third successive league championship in the 189394 season, finishing second behind Aston Villa. However, they regained the title in the 189495 season, ending the season five points ahead of Everton. After winning the English League Championship, Sunderland played against Heart of Midlothian, the champions of the Scottish League, in a game described as the Championship of the World title match.[11] Sunderland won the game 53 and were announced Champions of the world.[12] Sunderland came close to winning another league title in the 189798 season, when they finished as runners-up to Sheffield United.[13] That season was their last at Newcastle Road, as they moved to Roker Park the following season.[14] After coming second in 190001, the club won their fourth league title in the 190102 season, beating Everton by a three-point margin.[15] In 1904, Sunderlands management was embroiled in a payment scandal involving player Andrew McCombie. The club was said to have given the player 100 (9.7thousand today) to help him start his own business, on the understanding that he would repay the money after his benefit game.[16] However, McCombie refused to repay the money, claiming it had been a gift. An investigation conducted by the Football Association concluded that the money given to McCombie was part of a re-signing/win/draw bonus, which violated the Associations rules. Sunderland were fined 250 (24.3thousand today), and six directors were suspended for two and a half years for not showing a true record of the clubs financial dealings. Sunderland manager Alex Mackie was also suspended for three months for his involvement in the affair.[16][17] On 5 December 1908, Sunderland achieved their highest ever league win, against north-east rivals Newcastle United. They won the game 91; Billy Hogg and George Holley each scored hat-tricks.[18] The club won the league again in 1913,[19] but lost their first FA Cup final 10 to Aston Villa, in a very tough loss.[20] This was the closest the club has come to winning the league title and the FA Cup in the same season.[21] Two seasons later the First World War brought the league to a halt. After the leagues resumption, Sunderland came close to winning another championship in the 192223 season, when they were runners-up to Liverpool.[22] They also came close the following season, finishing third, four points from the top of the league.[23] The club escaped relegation from the First Division by one point in the 192728 season despite 35 goals from Dave Halliday. The point was won in a match against Middlesbrough, and they finished in fifteenth place.[24] Halliday improved his goal scoring to 43 goals in 42 games the following season,[25] an all-time Sunderland record for goals scored in a single season.[26] The clubs sixth league championship came in the 193536 season,[27] and they won the FA Cup the following season, after a 31 victory against Preston North End at Wembley Stadium.[28] The remainder of the decade saw mid-table finishes, until the league and FA Cup were suspended for the duration of the Second World War. Some football was still played as a morale boosting exercise, in the form of the Football League War Cup. Sunderland were finalists in the tournament in 1942, but were beaten by Wolverhampton Wanderers.[29] For Sunderland, the immediate post-war years were characterised by significant spending; the club paid 18,000 (574thousand today) for Carlisle Uniteds Ivor Broadis in January 1949.[16] Broadis was also Carlisles manager at the time, and this is the first instance of a player transferring himself to another club.[30] This, along with record-breaking transfer fees to secure the services of Len Shackleton and Welsh international Trevor Ford, led to a contemporary nickname, the Bank of England club.[31] The club finished third in the First Division in 1950,[32] their highest finish since the 1936 championship. The late 1950s saw a sharp downturn in Sunderlands fortunes, and the club was once again implicated in a major financial scandal in 1957.[17] Found guilty of making payments to players in excess of the maximum wage, they were fined 5,000 (109,000 today), and their chairman and three directors were suspended.[16][33][34] The following year, Sunderland were relegated from the highest division for the first time in their 68-year league history.[35] Sunderlands absence from the top flight lasted six years. The club came within one game of promotion back to the First Division in the 196263 season. Sunderland required only a draw in their final game against promotion rivals Chelsea, who had another game left to play after this match, to secure promotion. However, they were defeated,[36] and Chelsea won their last game 70 to clinch promotion, finishing ahead of Sunderland on goal average.[37] After the close call in the previous season, the club was promoted to Division One in 1964 after finishing in second place. Sunderland beat Charlton Athletic in the final stages of the season, where they clinched promotion with a game to spare.[38] At the end of the decade, they were again relegated to the Second Division after finishing 21st.[39] Sunderland won their last major trophy in 1973, in a 10 victory over Don Revies Leeds United in the FA Cup Final.[40] A Second Division club at the time, Sunderland won the game thanks mostly to the efforts of their goalkeeper Jimmy Montgomery, who saved two of Leeds shots at goal in quick succession, one being from hot-shot Peter Lorimer.[41] Ian Porterfield scored a volley in the 30th minute to beat Leeds and take the trophy.[41] Since 1973 only two other clubs, Southampton in 1976,[42] and West Ham United in 1980,[43] have equalled Sunderlands achievement of lifting the FA Cup while playing outside the top tier of English football. By winning the 1973 FA Cup Final, Sunderland qualified for the UEFA Cup Winners Cup, the clubs only appearance in European competition to date.[44] Sunderland beat Vasas Budapest 30 on aggregate, and were drawn against Lisbon club Sporting in the second round.[44] They won the first leg at Roker Park 21 but were defeated 20 in the away leg, and were knocked out of the competition 32 on aggregate.[44] After spending six seasons in the Second Division, Sunderland were promoted to Division One in the 197576 season; they topped the table over Bristol City by three points.[45] However, Sunderland were relegated the following season back into Division Two, without their FA Cup Final winning manager Bob Stokoe, who had resigned because of health problems at the start of the season.[46] The club celebrated its 100-year centenary in the 197980 season with a testimonial against an England XI side, which they lost 20.[47] Sunderland appeared in their first League Cup final in 1985, but lost 10 to Norwich City.[48] In 1987, Sunderland saw one of the lowest points in their history, when they were relegated to the Third Division of the English league for the first time.[49] Under new chairman Bob Murray and new manager Denis Smith, the club was promoted the following season.[50] In 1990, they were promoted back to the top flight in unusual circumstances. Sunderland lost to Swindon Town in the play-off final, but Swindons promotion was revoked after the club was found guilty of financial irregularities and Sunderland were promoted instead.[51] They stayed up for one year before being relegated on the final day of the following season.[52] Sunderlands next outing in a major final came in 1992 when, as a Second Division club, they returned to the FA Cup final. There was to be no repeat of the heroics of 1973, as Sunderland lost 20 to Liverpool.[53] In 1995, they faced the prospect of a return to the third-tier of English football.[54] Peter Reid was brought in as manager, and quickly turned things around. Reids time in charge had a stabilising effect; he remained manager for seven years.[55] After promotion from Division One in the 199596 season,[56] Sunderland began their first season in the Premier League, but finished third from the bottom and were relegated back to the First Division.[57] In 1997, Sunderland left Roker Park, their home for 99 years. Bearing fond memories of the stadium, former Sunderland player Len Shackleton said, There will never be another place like Roker.[58] The club moved to the Stadium of Light, a 42,000-seat arena that, at the time, was the largest stadium built in England after the Second World War.[59] The capacity was later increased to 49,000.[60] Sunderland returned to the Premier League as First Division champions in 1999 with a then-record 105 points.[61] Sunderlands 19992000 season started at Stamford Bridge, where Chelsea beat them 40.[62] However, in the return match later in the season Sunderland turned the tables on Chelsea, avenging their 40 defeat with a 41 win at the Stadium of Light.[63] Sunderland also achieved a 21 victory over rivals Newcastle United at St. James Park,[64] a result which helped bring about the resignation of Newcastles manager, Ruud Gullit.[65] At the end of the season Sunderland finished seventh, with Kevin Phillips winning the European Golden Shoe in his first top-flight season, scoring 30 goals.[66] Another seventh-place finish in the 200001 season was followed by two less successful seasons, and they were relegated to the second-tier with a then-record low 19 points in 2003.[26][67] Former Ireland manager Mick McCarthy took over at the club, and, in 2005, he took Sunderland up as champions for the third time in less than ten years.[26] However, the clubs stay in the top flight was short-live as Sunderland were once again relegated, this time with a new record-low total of 15 points. McCarthy left the club in mid-season, and he was replaced temporarily by former Sunderland player Kevin Ball.[68] The record-low fifteen-point performance was surpassed in the 200708 season by Derby County, who finished on eleven points.[69] Following Sunderlands relegation from the Premier League, the club was taken over by the Irish Drumaville Consortium,[26] headed by ex-player Niall Quinn, who appointed former Manchester United captain Roy Keane as the new manager.[70] Under Keane, the club rose steadily up the table with an unbeaten run of 17 games[71] to win promotion to the Premier League,[72] and were named winners of the Championship after beating Luton Town 50 at Kenilworth Road on 6 May 2007.[73] Following an inconsistent start to the 200809 season, Keane resigned.[74] Before the start of the following campaign, Irish-American businessman Ellis Short completed a full takeover of the club,[75] and Steve Bruce was announced as the next manager on 3 June.[76] One of Bruces first signings, Darren Bent, cost a club record fee of 10 million, broken a year later when they bought Ghana international Asamoah Gyan for around 13million.[77] Sunderland started the 201011 season strongly, but after Bent left for Aston Villa in January 2011 in a deal potentially worth 24 million, a record transfer fee received for the club,[78] they eventually finished 10th which was still their highest top-flight finish for 10 years.[79] Short replaced Quinn as chairman in October 2011, with Quinn becoming Director of International Development.[80] Bruce was sacked in November 2011,[81][82] and replaced by Martin ONeill.[83][84] In February 2012, Quinn left the club with immediate effect.[85] ONeill was sacked in March 2013[86] and Italian Paolo Di Canio was announced as his replacement the following day.[87] The appointment prompted the immediate resignation of club Vice Chairman David Miliband due to Di Canios past political statements.[88] Sunderland went on to survive relegation with one game to go. Over the summer, the club appointed Italian former agent Roberto De Fanti as the clubs first director of football.[89] Di Canio was sacked after a poor start to the 201314 season, and reports of a complete breakdown in relations with his players.[90] Gus Poyet was announced as his replacement,[91] and led Sunderland to the 2014 Football League Cup Final, where they were defeated 31 by Manchester City.[92] De Fanti was sacked as Director of Football in January 2014 and was replaced with Lee Congerton as Sporting Director.[93] In March 2015 Poyet was sacked,[94] and veteran Dutchman Dick Advocaat was appointed as the clubs new head coach,[95] saving the club from relegation.[96] Eight games into the 201516 season he resigned from the position.[97] Sam Allardyce was appointed the next manager in October 2015. Congerton left the club in December 2015, with the club apparently no longer wishing to use the Director of Football role.[98] Sunderland remained in the relegation zone for much of the remainder of the 201516 season, but Allardyce was able to save the club from being relegated with improved form in the second half of the season.[99] In July 2016, Allardyce left the club to be announced as manager for the English national team following the dismissal of Roy Hodgson after Englands disapointing EURO 2016 campaign.[100]. Former Everton and Manchester United manager David Moyes was appointed as his replacement on a 4-year contract.[101] Under Moyes, Sunderland made the worst ever start to a Premier League season, taking just 2 points from their opening 10 matches.[102] The club was relegated to the second tier for the first time in ten years at the end of the 201617 season, finishing bottom of the table with 24 points.[103] On 22 May 2017, Moyes resigned as manager of the club.[104] On 15 June 2017, goalkeeper Jordan Pickford, product of the Sunderlands academy, having joined the club aged eight, was transferred to Everton for a fee of 25 million, rising to a possible 30 million, a record for a British goalkeeper.[105] Sunderland played in an all blue strip from their formation until 1884,[26] when they adopted a red and white halved strip.[106] They assumed the current strip of red and white stripes in the 188788 season.[107] Their badge included a ship, the upper part of the Sunderland coat of arms, a black cat, and a football in front of Sunderlands red and white stripes.[108] In 1977 the badge was changed, but still included the ship, football and the background of red and white stripes.[109] This badge was used until the relocation from Roker Park to the Stadium of Light.[110] To coincide with the move, Sunderland released a new crest divided into four quarters; the upper right and lower left featured their traditional red and white colours, but the ship was omitted. The upper left section features the Penshaw Monument and the lower right section shows the Wearmouth Bridge.[110] A colliery wheel at the top of the crest commemorates County Durhams mining history, and the land the Stadium of Light was built on, formerly the Monkwearmouth Colliery. The crest also contains two lions, the black cats of Sunderland, and a banner displaying the clubs motto, Consectatio Excellentiae, which means In pursuit of excellence.[110] Sunderland have had seven stadiums throughout their history; the first was at Blue House Field in Hendon in 1879. The ground was close to the place where Sunderland formed, at Hendon Board School; at that time the rent for use of the ground was 10 (900 today).[16][111] The club relocated briefly to Groves Field in Ashbrooke in 1882, before moving again the following season.[112] The clubs third stadium was Horatio Street in Roker, the first Sunderland stadium north of the River Wear; the club played a single season there before another move,[113] this time to Abbs Field in Fulwell for two seasons. Abbs Field was notable for being the first Sunderland ground to which they charged admission.[114] Sunderland moved to Newcastle Road in 1886. By 1898, the ground reached a capacity of 15,000 after renovations, and its rent had risen to 100 (10thousand today) a year.[16][115] Near the turn of the 20th century, Sunderland needed a bigger stadium. They returned to Roker and set up home in Roker Park. It was opened on 10 September 1898, and the home team played a match the same day against Liverpool,[116] which they won. The stadiums capacity increased to 50,000 after redevelopment with architect Archibald Leitch in 1913. Sunderland were nearly bankrupted by the cost of renovating the Main Stand, and Roker Park was put up for sale but no further action was taken. On8 March 1933, an overcrowded Roker Park recorded the highest ever attendance at a Sunderland match, 75,118 against Derby County in a FA Cup sixth round replay.[26] Roker Park suffered a bombing in 1943, in which one corner of the stadium was destroyed. A special constable was killed while patrolling the stadium. By the 1990s, the stadium was no longer large enough, and had no room for possible expansion.[117] In January 1990, the Taylor Report was released after overcrowding at the Hillsborough Stadium resulted in 96 deaths, an incident known as the Hillsborough Disaster.[118] The report recommended that all major stadiums must be converted to an all-seater design.[119] As a result, Roker Parks capacity was reduced. It was demolished in 1997 and a housing estate built in its place.[116] In 1997, Sunderland moved to their present ground, Stadium of Light in Monkwearmouth, which was opened by Prince Andrew, Duke of York. Built with an original capacity of 42,000, it hosted its first game against Dutch team Ajax.[120] The stadium bears a similar name to the Portuguese club Benficas ground Estdio da Luz, albeit in a different language. Stadium expansion in 2000 saw the capacity increase to 49,000. A Davy lamp monument stands outside the stadium, and a miners banner was presented to the club by the Durham Miners Association,[121][122] as a reminder of the Monkwearmouth Colliery pit the stadium was built on. Sunderland held the seventh highest average home attendance out of the 20 clubs in the Premier League at the end of the 201314 season with an average of 41,089,[123] and held the sixth highest average attendance in the 201415 season with an average of over 43,000.[124] Sunderland fans often sell out allocations for away games: in the 201314 season, 9,000[125] Sunderland fans attended Old Trafford for the second leg of the Football League Cup semi-final, which they won to go through to the final. At Wembley, London was taken over by thousands of Mackems, the sights of Covent Garden and Leicester Square were awash with red and white, local shops completely sold out of alcohol but only one arrest was reported by the police.[126] Support is drawn from across the North East, in particular County Durham,[127] and beyond. The club has many supporter branches across the world, including the United States, Australia, Canada, Cambodia, and Greece.[128] According to YouGov statistics they are the most left-wing supporters in the Premier League,[129] and often sing The Red Flag during games.[130] Former chairman Bob Murray described Sunderland as a Labour Club.[122][131] Traditionally, Sunderlands main rivals are Newcastle United, with whom they contest the TyneWear derby. The club was rivals with the now defunct Sunderland Albion in the 1880s and 1890s; a breakaway club formed by Sunderlands founder James Allan.[132] Sections of fans share a mutual friendship with Dutch club Feyenoord, this was developed after Wearside shipbuilders found jobs in Rotterdam during the 1970s and 80s.[133] The club has an official quarterly magazine, called the Legion of Light, which season ticket holders receive for no cost.[134] One of the clubs current fanzine is A Love Supreme.[135] Others in the past have been Its The Hope I Cant Stand, Its An Easy One For Norman/Its An Easy One For Given, Sex and Chocolate, Wise Men Say and The Roker Roar (later The Wearside Roar).[136] Sunderland have recently created affiliations with several African clubs including Ghanas Asante Kotoko,[137] Eqypts El-Ittihad El-Iskandary [138] and South Africas Bidvest Wits. Sunderland also have an affiliation with Belgian side Lierse S.K., allowing the possibility for young African players who would not qualify for a UK work permit to spend three years with Lierse to gain a Belgian passport.[139] In August 2014, Sunderland announced a commercial partnership with Washington D.C. based MLS club D.C. United.[140] Sunderlands official nickname is The Black Cats. The previous nickname, The Rokerites, was made redundant after the club left Roker Park for the Stadium of Light in 1997.[141] The new name was decided upon in a public vote that year.[1] Despite the nickname being made official only relatively recently, the black cat has been used as an emblem of the club throughout most of its history. Photographs exist of players holding a black cat which made Roker Park its home in the 1900s and 1910s, and which was fed and watered by the football club.[142] A Sunderland supporter, Billy Morris, took a black cat in his top pocket as a good luck charm to the 1937 FA Cup final in which Sunderland brought home the trophy for the first time.[141][141] Since the 1960s the emblem of the Sunderland A.F.C. Supporters Association has been a black cat.[143] Reference has also been made to a Black Cat Battery, an Artillery battery based on the River Wear during the Napoleonic Wars.[141] As well as club nicknames, names have been used to define memorable periods in the clubs history. The Team of All Talents moniker was used during Sunderlands successful period in the 1890s,[26] and Sunderland were known as the Bank of England club during the 1950s. This was in reference to the clubs spending in the transfer market at the time, which saw the transfer-record broken twice.[26] The holder of the record for the most league appearances is Jimmy Montgomery, having made 527first team appearances between 1961 and 1976.[144] The clubs top league goal scorer is Charlie Buchan, who scored 209goals from 19111925;[145] Bobby Gurney is the record goalscorer over all competitions with 227goals between 1926and1939.[146] Dave Halliday holds the record for the most goals scored in a season: 43in the 192829 season in the Football League First Division.[145] As of October 2014 John OShea is the most capped player for the club, making 100appearances for the Republic of Ireland.[145] The clubs widest victory margin in the league was in the 91 win against Newcastle United in the First Division in 1908. Sunderlands biggest ever win in the FA cup was against Fair field (a non-league team) and the final score was 111.[147] Their heaviest defeats in the league were 80 against Sheffield Wednesday in 1911, West Ham United in 1968, Watford in 1982 and Southampton in 2014[147] Sunderland joined the top division in England, The Football League, in the 189091 season and were not relegated until 195758 (a span of 67seasons). In October 2015, Sunderland defeated rivals Newcastle United for the sixth consecutive time, a new record. Sunderlands record home attendance is 75,200 for a sixth round replay FA Cup match against Derby County on 8 March 1933.[148] The biggest transfer fee Sunderland have ever received for one of their players is 24 million for Darren Bent who moved to Aston Villa on 18 January 2011. The biggest fee Sunderland have received for a player produced by the Sunderland academy is 16 million (rising to a possible 20 million) for Jordan Henderson, who moved to Liverpool on 9 July 2011. The biggest transfer fee paid by Sunderland is the eventual 16 million after add-ons for Bent, who was bought from Tottenham Hotspur in July 2009. As of the 201516 season The first sponsor to appear on Sunderland kits was Cowies, the business group of then chairman Tom Cowie, between 198385.[149][150] The club was sponsored by the Vaux Breweries between 1985 and 1999, with drink brands such as Lambtons sometimes appearing on kits. Subsequently, the club were sponsored by Sunderland car dealership company Reg Vardy from 1999 to 2007.[149] Sunderland were sponsored by the Irish bookmaker Boylesports, who signed a four-year contract with the club in 2007 worth up to 12million.[151] In April 2010, Sunderland signed a two-year shirt sponsorship deal with tombola, a local online bingo company.[152] On 25 June 2012, Sunderland announced the strengthening of their partnership with the Invest in Africa initiative, with the initiative becoming the clubs shirt sponsor for two years. The project is closely linked with Tullow Oil.[153] However, after a year the club announced a new sponsorship deal with South African company Bidvest. On 1 June 2015 Sunderland announced a new sponsorship with Dafabet to appear on the kits for the following season.[154] The first kit manufacturer to appear on Sunderland kits was Umbro, between 197581. French brand Le Coq Sportif produced kits between 198183. Nikes first stint as kit manufacturer came between 198386, before kits from Patrick (198688), Hummel (198894), Avec (199497) and Asics (199700). Nike returned between 200004. Diadora produced kits for a solitary season, 200405, and Lonsdale made kits between 200507. Umbro returned for five seasons between 200712, before Adidas became the clubs kit manufacturer for the first time in 2012.[155] Note: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules. Players may hold more than one non-FIFA nationality. The following are the honours Sunderland have achieved since their foundation in 1879.[158][159][160]

The club currently plays in the Championship, the second tier of English football, having been relegated from the Premier League in 2016. They were first promoted to the top flight in 1972. Norwich have won the League Cup twice, in 1962 and 1985. The club has never won the top flight, but finished third in 1993. The club was founded in 1902. Since 1935, Norwich have played their home games at Carrow Road and have a long-standing and fierce rivalry with East Anglian rivals Ipswich Town, with whom they have contested the East Anglian derby 134 times since 1902. The fans song On the Ball, City is regarded as being the oldest football song in the world which is still in use. The club plays in characteristic yellow and green kits and are nicknamed The Canaries after the history of breeding the birds in the area.   Norwich City F.C. was formed following a meeting at the Criterion Cafe in Norwich on 17 June 1902 and played their first competitive match against Harwich & Parkeston, at Newmarket Road on 6 September 1902.[2] They joined the Norfolk & Suffolk League for the 190203 season,[3] but following a FA Commission, the club was ousted from the amateur game in 1905, deemed a professional organisation. Later that year Norwich were elected to play in the Southern League and with increasing crowds, they were forced to leave Newmarket Road in 1908, moving to The Nest, a disused chalk pit. The clubs original nickname was the Citizens, although this was superseded by 1907 by the more familiar Canaries after the clubs chairman (who was a keen breeder of canaries) dubbed his boys The Canaries and changing their strip to yellow and green. During the First World War, with football suspended and facing spiralling debts, City went into voluntary liquidation on 10 December 1917.[4] The club was officially reformed on 15 February 1919  a key figure in the events was Charles Frederick Watling, future Lord Mayor of Norwich and the father of future club chairman, Geoffrey Watling.[5] When, in May 1920, the Football League formed a third Division, Norwich joined the Third Division for the following season.[6] Their first league fixture, against Plymouth Argyle, on 28 August 1920, ended in a 11 draw. The club went on to endure a mediocre decade, finishing no higher than eighth but no lower than 18th.[4] The following decade proved more successful for the club with a club-record victory, 102, over Coventry City and promotion as champions to the Second Division in the 193334 season under the management of Tom Parker.[7] With crowds continuing to rise, and with the Football Association raising concerns over the suitability of The Nest, the club considered renovation of the ground, but ultimately decided on a move to Carrow Road. The inaugural match, held on 31 August 1935, against West Ham United, ended in a 43 victory to the home team and set a new record attendance of 29,779. The biggest highlight of the following four seasons was the visit of King George VI to Carrow Road on 29 October 1938. However, the club was relegated to the Third Division at the end of the season.[8] The league was suspended the following season as a result of the outbreak of the Second World War and did not resume until the 194647 season.[4] City finished this and the following season in 21st place,[9][10] the poor results forcing the club to apply for re-election to the league.[11] The club narrowly missed out on promotion under the guidance of manager Norman Low in the early 1950s, but following the return of Tom Parker as manager, Norwich finished bottom of the football league in the 195657 season.[12] The 195859 season saw Norwich reach the semi-final of the FA Cup as a Third Division side, defeating two First Division sides on the way: Tottenham Hotspur and Matt Busbys Manchester United.[11][13] In the 195960 season, Norwich were promoted to the Second Division after finishing second to Southampton, and achieved a fourth-place finish in the 196061 season.[11] In 1962 Ron Ashman guided Norwich to their first trophy, defeating Rochdale 40 on aggregate in a two-legged final to win the League Cup.[14] Sixth place in the league was the closest the club came to promotion to the First Division again during the 1960s, but after winning the division in the 197172 season under manager Ron Saunders, Norwich City reached the highest level of English football for the first time.[15] They made their first appearance at Wembley Stadium in 1973, losing the League Cup final 10 to Tottenham Hotspur.[16] Relegation to the Second Division in 1974 came after Saunders had departed and been succeeded by John Bond, but the board of directors kept faith in Bond and were quickly rewarded.[15] A highly successful first season saw promotion back to the First Division and another visit to Wembley, again in the League Cup final, this time losing 10 to Aston Villa.[17] Bond departed to Manchester City in the autumn of 1980 and the club were relegated six months later, but bounced back the following season after finishing third under Bonds successor Ken Brown. Norwich had also been the beneficiaries of one of English footballs first million-pound transfers when they sold striker Justin Fashanu to Nottingham Forest in August 1981.[18] The 198485 season was of mixed fortunes for the club; under Ken Browns guidance, they reached the final of the Football League Cup at Wembley Stadium, having defeated Ipswich Town in the semi-final. In the final, they beat Sunderland 10, but in the league both Norwich and Sunderland were relegated to the second tier of English football. This made Norwich the first English club to win a major trophy and suffer relegation in the same season; something which was not matched until Birmingham City also suffered relegation the season they won the League Cup 26 years later. Norwich were also denied their first foray into Europe with the ban on English clubs after the Heysel Stadium disaster.[19][20] City bounced back to the top flight by winning the Second Division championship in the 198586 season.[21] This was the start of what remains in 2017 a club-record nine consecutive seasons in the top division of English football.[22] High league placings in the First Division in 198687 and 198889 would have been enough for UEFA Cup qualification, but the ban on English clubs remained.[20] They also had good cup runs during this period, reaching the FA Cup semi-finals in 1989 and again in 1992.[23][24] During 199293, the inaugural season of the Premier League, Norwich City quickly emerged as surprise title contenders,[25] before faltering in the final weeks to finish third behind the champions, Manchester United, and runners-up Aston Villa. Their top scorer that season was Mark Robins, who had been signed from Manchester United the previous summer.[26] The following season Norwich played in the UEFA Cup for the first time, losing in the third round to Inter Milan, but defeating Bayern Munich. Winning 21, Norwich were the first British team to beat Bayern Munich in the Olympic Stadium.[27] Mike Walker quit as Norwich City manager in January 1994,[28] to take charge of Everton and was replaced by 36-year-old first team coach John Deehan who led the club to 12th place in the 199394 season in the Premier League.[29] Norwich began the 199495 season well, despite the pre-season loss of top scorer Chris Sutton to Blackburn Rovers for a national record 5million, and by Christmas they were seventh in the league and a UEFA Cup place was a realistic possibility. However, Norwich then went into freefall, won only one of their final 20 league games and slumped to 20th place and relegation, ending a nine-season run in the top flight.[30] Shortly before relegation, Deehan resigned as manager and his assistant Gary Megson took over until the end of the season.[31] Martin ONeill, who had taken Wycombe Wanderers from the Conference to the Second Division with successive promotions, was appointed as Norwich City manager in the summer of 1995.[32] He lasted just six months in the job before resigning after a dispute with chairman Robert Chase over money to strengthen the squad.[33] Soon after, Chase stepped down after protests from supporters, who complained that he kept selling the clubs best players and was to blame for their relegation.[34] Chases majority stakeholding was bought by Geoffrey Watling.[35] English television cook Delia Smith and husband Michael Wynn-Jones took over the majority of Norwich Citys shares from Watling in 1996,[35] and Mike Walker was re-appointed as the clubs manager.[36] He was unable to repeat the success achieved during his first spell and was sacked two seasons later with Norwich mid-table in Division One.[37] Nigel Worthington took over as Norwich City manager in December 2000 following an unsuccessful two years for the club under Bruce Rioch and then Bryan Hamilton. He had been on the coaching staff under Hamilton who resigned with the club 20th in the First Division and in real danger of relegation to the third tier of English football for the first time since the 1960s.[38] Worthington avoided the threat of relegation and, the following season, led City to a playoff final at the Millennium Stadium, which Norwich lost against Birmingham City on penalties.[39] The 200304 campaign saw the club win the First Division title, finishing eight points clear of second-placed West Bromwich Albion and returned to the top flight for the first time since 1995.[40] For much of the 200405 season however, the club struggled and, despite beating Manchester United 20 towards the end of the season,[41] a last day 60 defeat away to Fulham condemned them to relegation.[42] The club finished in ninth place in The Championship in the 200506 season[43] and, as results in the 200607 season went against City, manager Nigel Worthington was sacked in October 2006, directly after a 41 defeat by Burnley.[44] On 16 October 2006, Norwich revealed that former City player Peter Grant had left West Ham United to become the new manager,[45] and in February 2007, Grant replaced assistant Doug Livermore with his fellow Scot, Jim Duffy. [46] Grants side struggled for most of the season and made a poor start to the 200708 season, with only two wins by mid October; following a 10 defeat at fellow-strugglers Queens Park Rangers, Grant left the club by mutual consent on 9 October 2007.[47] On 30 October 2007, former Newcastle United manager Glenn Roeder was confirmed as Grants replacement.[48] Roeder kept Norwich in the Championship with a 30 win over Queens Park Rangers, Norwichs penultimate game of the season. On 14 January 2009 it was announced that Roeder had been relieved of his first team duties after 60 games in charge, and just 20 victories.[49] A week later, Bryan Gunn was appointed as manager until the end of the season,[50] but he was unable to prevent the club from being relegated on 3 May 2009, after a 42 defeat away at already relegated Charlton Athletic.[51] Following their relegation, their first game of the season resulted in a shock 71 home defeat against East Anglian rivals Colchester United. This was the clubs heaviest ever home defeat, succeeding a record that had stood since 1946. Two fans entered the pitch and ripped up their season tickets after just 22 minutes when the team were already 40 down,[52] and Gunn was sacked six days later.[53] On 18 August 2009, Paul Lambert was announced as the new manager, leaving his post at Colchester, and nine months later led Norwich to promotion back to the Championship as League One Champions, after a single season in League One.[54][55] The following season saw Norwich promoted to the Premier League, finishing second in the table behind QPR and completing the first back-to-back promotions from the 3rd tier to the 1st since Manchester City in 2000.[56] The club finished in 12th place in their first season back in the Premier League. Manager Paul Lambert resigned within a month of the seasons close to take up the vacant managerial spot at league rivals Aston Villa, and was replaced by Chris Hughton. The 201213 season started poorly with a 50 defeat to Fulham and a bad run of form that was followed by a club record unbeaten run in the Premier League. A 10 home defeat to Luton Town on 26 January 2013 resulted in Norwich becoming the first English top-flight team to lose a FA Cup tie to a non-league side in 24 years.[57] Norwich secured their third year in the Premier League with consecutive victories in the last two games of the season, to finish 11th in the league. However they were relegated back to the Championship after finishing 18th in the 201314 season. After a mediocre first half of the 201415 season, Neil Adams resigned which paved the way for the appointment of then Hamilton Academical manager Alex Neil in January 2015. The appointment reinvigorated Norwichs season and after narrowly missing out on automatic promotion back to the Premier League, victory in the 2015 Championship playoff final secured an immediate return to the top division of English football.[58] This was only temporary relief, however, as at the end of the next season they were relegated again to play season 2016/17 in the Football League Championship [59]. The following season started successfully, with the club sitting top of the Championship in mid October. However, a poor run of form and results followed, which included five consecutive defeats, and saw the team slide to as low as twelfth in the table. On 10 March 2017, Alex Neil was sacked by the club [60], with first team coach Alan Irvine placed in caretaker charge for the remainder of the season, which saw the club finish eighth in the Championship. On 25 May 2017, the club appointed German coach Daniel Farke as head coach, becoming the first foreign head coach of the club in its 114-year history.[61] Norwich Citys nickname, The Canaries, has long influenced the teams colours and crest. Originally, the club was nicknamed the Citizens (Cits for short), and played in light blue and white halved shirts,[4] although the halves were inconsistent; the blue was sometimes on the left hand side of the shirt and sometimes on the right.[62] The earliest known recorded link between the club and canaries, comes in an interview recorded in the Eastern Daily Press with newly appointed manager, John Bowman in April 1905. The paper quotes him saying Well I knew of the Citys existence... I have... heard of the canaries.[63] This as far as we can tell is the first time that the popular pastime of the day ie... rearing... canaries was linked with Norwich City FC... the club still played in blue and white, and would continue to do so for another two seasons.[63] But the city of Norwich had long connections with canaries owing to its 15th and 16th century links to Flemish weavers who had imported the birds to the Low Countries from the Dutch colonies in the Caribbean. By February 1907, the nickname Canaries had come more into vogue; thoughts that an FA Cup tie against West Bromwich Albion (nicknamed Throstles after a bird) was a bird -singing contest were dismissed by the polymath C.B. Fry as humbug but Bowman and Frys colleagues in the national press increasingly referred to the team as Canaries.[64] The following season, to match the nickname, City played for the first time in Canary livery; yellow shirts with green collars and cuffs. One paper produced the quote The Cits are dead but the Canaries are very much alive.[65] Apart from the obvious colour link, a canary may seem an odd choice; however, many English football clubs have adopted small birds as emblems that symbolise agility and deftness around the field.[66] While the home colours of yellow and green remain to this day, the away colours have varied since introduction. For example, the away kit for the 201213 season was black shirts and shorts.[67] A simple canary badge was first adopted in 1922.[68] The current club badge consists of a canary resting on a football with a stylised version of the City of Norwich arms in the top left corner.[69] For the clubs centenary celebrations in 2002, a special crest was designed. It featured two canaries looking left and right, and a ribbon noting the centenary.[70] Norwich City F.C. played at Newmarket Road from 1902 to 1908, with a record attendance of 10,366 against Sheffield Wednesday in a second round FA Cup match in 1908.[71] Following a dispute over the conditions of renting the Newmarket Road ground, in 1908, the club moved to a new home in a converted disused chalk pit in Rosary Road which became known as The Nest.[72] By the 1930s, the ground capacity was proving insufficient for the growing crowds and in 1935 the club moved to its current home in Carrow Road.[73] The original stadium, the largest construction job in the city since the building of Norwich Castle... was miraculously built in just 82 days... it was referred to [by club officials] as The eighth wonder of the world[74][75] An aerial photograph from August 1935 shows three sides of open terracing and a covered stand, with a Colmans Mustard advertisement painted on its roof, visible only from the air.[76] Another photograph, taken on a match day that same season, shows that despite the eras limited car ownership, a parking area was provided at the ground.[77] Floodlights were erected at the ground in 1956 whose 9,000 costs nearly sent the club into bankruptcy but the success in the 1959 FA Cup secured the financial status of the club and allowed for a cover to be built over the South Stand, which was itself replaced in 2003 when a new 7,000 seat South stand, subsequently renamed the Jarrold Stand, was built in its place.[73] 1963 saw the record attendance for Carrow Road, with a crowd of 43,984 for a 6th round FA Cup match against Leicester City, but in the wake of the Ibrox disaster in 1971, safety licences were required by clubs which resulted in the capacity being drastically reduced to around 20,000. A two-tier terrace was built at the River End and soon after seats began to replace the terraces. By 1979 the stadium had a capacity of 28,392 with seats for 12,675. A fire in 1984 partially destroyed one of the stands which eventually led to its complete demolition and replacement by 1987 of a new City Stand, which chairman Robert Chase described as Coming to a football match within the City Stand is very much like going to the theatre  the only difference being that our stage is covered with grass.[73] After the Hillsborough disaster in 1989 and the subsequent outcome of the Taylor Report in 1990, the stadium was converted to all-seater with the corners being filled. Today, Carrow Road is an all-seater stadium, with a capacity of just over 27,000.[78] While much of the support that the club enjoys is local, there are a number of exile fan clubs, notably in London and stretching from Scandinavia to countries further afield such as the United Arab Emirates, Bermuda, Hong Kong, Thailand, Australia and the United States.[79] The fans song, On the Ball, City, is the oldest football song in the world still in use today; the song is in fact older than the club itself having probably been penned for Norwich Teachers or Caleys FC in the 1890s and adapted for Norwich City.[63] Although the first use of the tune and song is disputed, it had been adopted by 1902 and it remains in use today in part if not the whole.[63] The chorus is:[80] Keep it low, a splendid rush, bravo, win or die;\nOn the ball City, never mind the danger,\nSteady on, nows your chance,\nHurrah! Weve scored a goal, City! City! City! Locally, much is made of the informal title Pride of Anglia. Fans variously claim the title for either winning the East Anglian Derby, finishing highest in the league, having the better current league position, having the more successful club history or for reasons without any apparent logical basis. The clubs main local rival is Ipswich Town. When Norwich and Ipswich meet it is known as the East Anglian Derby, or, informally, as the Old Farm Derby  a comic reference to the Old Firm Derby played between Scottish teams Celtic and Rangers.[81] Over the 134 matches played against Ipswich since 1902, Ipswich has the better record, having won 45 of the matches to Norwichs 37.[82][i] Another commonly employed measure for Pride of Anglia, and one that encompasses all of the East Anglian teams is to dub the side finishing as the highest placed East Anglian team in the Football League as the Pride of Anglia.[83][84] The club also maintains a healthy celebrity support with celebrity cook Delia Smith and comedian Stephen Fry both having moved from fans of the club to running it.[85] Actor Hugh Jackman is also a fan of the club, having been taken to Carrow Road as a child by his English mother, though he turned down an opportunity to become an investor in the club in 2010.[86] BT Sport Presenter Jake Humphrey, who was born in Peterborough but moved to Norwich with his family at the age of nine, is another celebrity supporter.[87][88] Also Sky Sports presenter Simon Thomas, who is Vice-President of the Norwich City Supporters Trust,[88][89] Norfolk-born musician, model and media personality Myleene Klass, singer Sophie Ellis-Bextor,[90] and Labour ex-politician Ed Balls.[91][92] Journalist and broadcaster Sir David Frost OBE also declared his love for The Canaries during his lifetime.[93] Norwich City FC is a public limited company that, in 2003, comprised approximately 8,000 individual shareholdings.[94] Since purchasing their shares from Geoffrey Watling, Delia Smith and husband Michael Wynn-Jones have been joint majority shareholders.[35] At the 200607 Norwich City FC Annual General Meeting (on 18 January 2007) Smith and Wynn-Jones announced that they would be open to offers to buy their majority stake-holding in the club. However, they made clear that any prospective buyer would have to invest heavily in the squad, with regards to team improving.[95] On 8 May 2007 the football club announced that Andrew and Sharon Turner had bought out all 5,000 shares belonging to former Board member, Barry Skipper and had given the club an interest-free loan of 2m. Mr and Mrs Turner are owners and directors of personal finance company Central Trust. During July 2008 Peter Cullum declared that he was interested in a takeover of the club, and pledged that he would invest 20m for enhancement of the playing squad. On 8 July the EDP reported that Delia Smith and the board had invited Peter Cullum for talks. Reports later stated that the talks had been terminated with immediate effect, and no deal was to be reached. On 2 September 2008, Andrew and Sharon Turner announced that they were leaving the football clubs board of directors. This left a 2million hole in Norwich Citys budget. On 4 September 2008, Delia Smith and Michael Wynn-Jones announced that they would be injecting 2million, avoiding financial problems for the club. The 2011 Annual General Meeting, attended by over 500 shareholders,[96] saw joint majority shareholder Delia Smith and Stephan Phillips re-elected as directors and new director Stephen Fry formally re-elected having joined the Board the previous August.[96] On 27 December 2015, former Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls was appointed Chairman.[97] Kevin Keelan holds the record for Norwich appearances, having played 673 first-team matches between 1963 and 1980. Ralph Hunt holds the record for the most goals scored in a season, 31 in the 195556 season in Division Three (South), with Johnny Gavin the top scorer over a career  122 between 1948 and 1955. Mark Bowen holds the club record for most international caps, with 35 for Wales.[98] The clubs widest victory margin in the league was their 102 win against Coventry City in the Division Three (South) in 1930. Their heaviest defeat in the league was 102 against Swindon Town in 1908 in the Southern Football League. Norwichs record home attendance is 43,984 for a sixth round FA Cup match against Leicester City on 30 March 1963. With the introduction of regulations enforcing all-seater stadiums, it is unlikely that this record will be beaten in the foreseeable future. The highest transfer fee received for a Norwich player is 10million, from Southampton for Nathan Redmond in June 2016, while the most spent by the club on a player was the signing of Ricky van Wolfswinkel for 8.5million (10million) from Sporting Lisbon.[99] This transfer fee was then equaled by the signing of Steven Naismith from Everton in January 2016.[100] The clubs highest league finish was third in the FA Premier League in 199293.[78] The 201516 season was Norwichs 25th in the top flight of English football. The club has won the League Cup twice (most recently in 1985) and reached the FA Cup semi-final three times, most recently in 1992.[78] Norwich have taken part in European competition just once, reaching the third round of the UEFA Cup in 199394 and are the only British side to beat Bayern Munich in the Olympic Stadium.[25] Source:[101] Between 2006 and 2008 the club was sponsored by airline Flybe but on 26 April 2008, it was announced that the company was stepping down as the main sponsor.[102] On 29 April 2008 it was announced that Aviva which has offices in the city and is the parent company of the former Norwich Union, would be the new shirt sponsor, having signed a three-year contract.[103] In 2009 the deal was extended until the end of the 201112 season.[104] It was further extended in 2012 by four more years to the end of the 201516 season. During the 2016-17 season Aviva Community Fund were Norwichs main shirt sponsor. Note: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules. Players may hold more than one non-FIFA nationality. During the clubs centenary season, a Hall of Fame was created, honouring 100 former players chosen by fan vote. Further players have been inducted into the Norwich City Hall of Fame in 2003, 2006 and 2012. In 2008, supporters cast votes to determine the greatest ever Norwich City team.[108] For a list of Norwich City captains, see Norwich City captains Norwich City have won a number of honours, including the following:[116] Football League Second Division/First Division/Championship (Level 2)[ii] Football League Third Division/One (Level 3) League Cup[iii] Each time they meet, Norwich and Sunderland contest the Friendship Trophy, an honour dating back to the camaraderie forged between fans of the two clubs at the time of the 1985 League Cup final that they contested.[117] Sunderland are the current holders having beaten Norwich 30 at Carrow Road on 16 April 2016 in the 2015-16 Premier League. In the 2001 film Mike Bassett: England Manager,[118] the eponymous hero, played by Ricky Tomlinson, rises to prominence as a result of success as manager of Norwich City, having won the Mr Clutch Cup. The celebratory scenes of the open-top bus ride around the city (right) were actually shot in St Albans, Hertfordshire, rather than Norwich. In 1972 the Childrens Film Foundation released a movie called The Boy Who Turned Yellow, about a boy living in London who supports Norwich City. In the film, he and everyone and everything else on his tube train are turned yellow. That night he is visited by a yellow alien called Nick, short for electronic, who teaches him all about electricity. The link to the football club is used to explain why the boy already has so many yellow things in his bedroom.[119] Norwich City Ladies is the womens football club affiliated to Norwich City.[120] They are managed by Scott Emmerson and compete in the Womens South East Combination League, in the third tier of English womens football.[120] According to Norwich City, They are the official womens team of Norwich City Football Club and are linked to the Girls Centre of Excellence programme.[120] Consequently, 95 of the clubs players have progressed from the youth ranks. Norwich City LFC play their home games at Plantation Park, Blofield, Norwich.[120]

(Spanish pronunciation:[real mai klu e fuol]; Royal Madrid Football Club), commonly known as Real Madrid, or simply as Real, is a professional football club based in Madrid, Spain. Founded in 1902 as Madrid Football Club, the club has traditionally worn a white home kit since inception. The word Real is Spanish for Royal and was bestowed to the club by King Alfonso XIII in 1920 together with the royal crown in the emblem. The team has played its home matches in the 81,044-capacity Santiago Bernabu Stadium in downtown Madrid since 1947. Unlike most European sporting entities, Real Madrids members (socios) have owned and operated the club throughout its history. The club was estimated to be worth 3.24billion ($3.65billion) in 2015, and in the 201415 season it was the worlds highest-earning football club, with an annual revenue of 577million.[5][6][7] The club is one of the most widely supported teams in the world.[8] Real Madrid is one of three founding members of the Primera Divisin that have never been relegated from the top division, along with Athletic Bilbao and Barcelona. The club holds many long-standing rivalries, most notably El Clsico with Barcelona and El Derbi with Atltico Madrid. Real Madrid established itself as a major force in both Spanish and European football during the 1950s, winning five consecutive European Cups and reaching the final seven times. This success was replicated in the league, where the club won five times in the space of seven years. This team, which consisted of players such as Alfredo Di Stfano, Ferenc Pusks, Francisco Gento and Raymond Kopa, is considered by some in the sport to be the greatest team of all time.[9][10][11] In domestic football, the club has won 63 major trophies; a record 33 La Liga titles, 19 Copa del Rey, 9 Supercopa de Espaa, a Copa Eva Duarte, and a Copa de la Liga.[12] In European and Worldwide competitions, the club has won a record 22 major trophies; a record 12 European Cup/UEFA Champions League titles, two UEFA Cups and three UEFA Super Cups. Whilst in international football, they are the only Spanish club to have won both international titles, a joint record three Intercontinental Cups, and two FIFA Club World Cups.[13] Real Madrid were recognised as the FIFA Club of the 20th Century on 11 December 2000,[14] and received the FIFA Centennial Order of Merit on 20 May 2004.[15] The club was also awarded Best European Club of the 20th Century by the IFFHS on 11 May 2010. In June 2017 the team succeeded in becoming the first club to win back to back Champions Leagues, extending their lead atop the UEFA club rankings. [16][17]   Real Madrids origins go back to when football was introduced to Madrid by the academics and students of the Institucin Libre de Enseanza, which included several Cambridge and Oxford University graduates. They founded Football Club Sky in 1897, playing on Sunday mornings at Moncloa. It split into two clubs in 1900: New Foot-Ball de Madrid and Madrid Football Club.[18] On 6 March 1902, after a new Board presided by Juan Padrs had been elected, Madrid Football Club was officially founded.[3] Three years after its foundation, in 1905, Madrid FC won its first title after defeating Athletic Bilbao in the Spanish Cup final. The club became one of the founding sides of the Royal Spanish Football Federation on 4 January 1909, when club president Adolfo Melndez signed the foundation agreement of the Spanish FA. After moving between grounds the team moved to the Campo de ODonnell in 1912.[19] In 1920, the clubs name was changed to Real Madrid after King Alfonso XIII granted the title of Real (Royal) to the club.[20] In 1929, the first Spanish football league was founded. Real Madrid led the first league season until the last match, a loss to Athletic Bilbao, meant they finished runners-up to Barcelona.[21] Real Madrid won its first League title in the 193132 season. Real won the League again the following year, becoming the first team to have won the championship twice.[22] On 14 April 1931, the arrival of the Second Spanish Republic caused the club to lose the title Real and went back to being named Madrid Football Club. Football continued during the Second World War, and on 13 June 1943 Madrid beat Barcelona 111 in the second leg of a semi-final[23] of the Copa del Generalsimo, the Copa del Rey having been renamed in honour of General Franco. It has been suggested that Barcelona players were intimidated by police,[24] including by the director of state security who allegedly told the team that some of them were only playing because of the regimes generosity in permitting them to remain in the country.[25] The Barcelona chairman, Enric Pieyro, was assaulted by Madrid fans.[26] However, none of these allegations have been proven and FIFA and UEFA still consider the result as legitimate. According to Spanish journalist and writer, Juan Carlos Pasamontes, Barcelona player Josep Valle denied that the Spanish security forces came before the match.[27] Instead, at the end of the first half, Barcelona coach Juan Jos Nogus and all of his players were angry with the hard-style of play Real Madrid was using and with the aggressiveness of the home crowd.[27] When they refused to take the field, the Superior Chief of Police of Madrid appeared, identified himself, and ordered the team to take the field.[27] Santiago Bernabu Yeste became president of Real Madrid in 1945.[28] Under his presidency, the club, its stadium Santiago Bernabu and its training facilities Ciudad Deportiva were rebuilt after the Spanish Civil War damages. Additionally, during the 1950s former Real Madrid Amateurs player Miguel Malbo founded Real Madrids youth academy, or cantera, known today as La Fbrica. Beginning in 1953, he embarked upon a strategy of signing world-class players from abroad, the most prominent being Alfredo Di Stfano.[29] In 1955, acting upon the idea proposed by the French sports journalist and editor of Lquipe Gabriel Hanot, Bernabu, Bedrignan and Gusztv Sebes created an exhibition tournament of invited teams from around Europe that would eventually become what today is known as the UEFA Champions League.[30] It was under Bernabus guidance that Real Madrid established itself as a major force in both Spanish and European football. The club won the European Cup five times in a row between 1956 and 1960, which included the 73 Hampden Park final against Eintracht Frankfurt in 1960.[29] After these five consecutive successes, Real was permanently awarded the original cup and earning the right to wear the UEFA badge of honour.[31] The club won the European Cup for a sixth time in 1966 defeating Partizan Belgrade 21 in the final with a team composed entirely of same nationality players, a first in the competition.[32] This team became known as the Y-y. The name Ye-y came from the Yeah, yeah, yeah chorus in The Beatles song She Loves You after four members of the team posed for Marca and impersonated the Beatles.[33] The Ye-y generation was also European Cup runner-up in 1962 and 1964.[32] In the 1970s, Real Madrid won five league championships and three Spanish Cups.[34] The club played its first UEFA Cup Winners Cup final in 1971 and lost to English side Chelsea 21.[35] On 2 July 1978, club president Santiago Bernabu died while the World Cup was being played in Argentina. FIFA decreed three days of mourning to honour him during the tournament.[36] The following year, the club organized the first edition of the Trofeo Santiago Bernabu in the memory of its former president. By the early 1980s, Real Madrid had lost its grasp on the Liga title until a new cohort of home-grown stars brought domestic success back to the club.[37] Spanish sport journalist Julio Csar Iglesias gave to this generation the name La Quinta del Buitre (Vultures Cohort), which was derived from the nickname given to one of its members, Emilio Butragueo. The other four members were Manuel Sanchs, Martn Vzquez, Mchel and Miguel Pardeza; all five footballers were graduates of Real Madrids youth academy.[37] With La Quinta del Buitre (reduced to four members when Pardeza left for Zaragoza in 1986) and notable players like goalkeeper Francisco Buyo, right-back Miguel Porln Chendo and Mexican striker Hugo Snchez, Real Madrid had one of the best teams in Spain and Europe during the second half of the 1980s, winning two UEFA Cups, five Spanish championships in a row, one Spanish cup and three Spanish Super Cups.[37] In the early 1990s, La Quinta del Buitre split up after Martn Vzquez, Emilio Butragueo and Mchel left the club. In 1996, President Lorenzo Sanz appointed Fabio Capello as coach. Although his tenure lasted only one season, Real Madrid was proclaimed league champion and players like Roberto Carlos, Predrag Mijatovi, Davor uker and Clarence Seedorf arrived at the club to strengthen a squad that already boasted the likes of Ral, Fernando Hierro, Ivn Zamorano, and Fernando Redondo. As a result, Real Madrid (with the addition of Fernando Morientes in 1997) finally ended its 32-year wait for its seventh European Cup: in 1998, under manager Jupp Heynckes, they defeated Juventus 10 in the final with a goal from Predrag Mijatovi.[38] In July 2000, Florentino Prez was elected club president.[39] He vowed in his campaign to erase the clubs 270 million debt and modernize the clubs facilities. However, the primary electoral promise that propelled Prez to victory was the signing of Lus Figo from arch-rivals Barcelona.[40] The following year, the club had its training ground rezoned and used the money to begin assembling the Galcticos team by signing a global star every summer, which included Zinedine Zidane, Ronaldo, Lus Figo, Roberto Carlos, Ral, David Beckham and Fabio Cannavaro.[41] It is debatable whether the gamble paid off, as despite winning the UEFA Champions League and an Intercontinental Cup in 2002, followed by La Liga in 2003, the club failed to win a major trophy for the next three seasons.[42] The few days after the capturing of the 2003 Liga title were surrounded with controversy. The first controversial decision came when Prez sacked winning coach Vicente del Bosque.[43] Over a dozen players left the club, including Madrid captain Fernando Hierro, while defensive midfielder Claude Makll refused to take part in training in protest at being one of the lowest-paid players at the club and subsequently moved to Chelsea.[44] Thats a lot [of players leaving] when the normal rule is: never change a winning team, stated Zidane.[45] Real Madrid, with newly appointed coach Carlos Queiroz, started their domestic league slowly after a hard win over Real Betis.[45] The 200506 season began with the promise of several new signings: Jlio Baptista (24 million), Robinho (30 million) and Sergio Ramos (27 million).[46] However, Real Madrid suffered from some poor results, including a 03 loss at the hands of Barcelona at the Santiago Bernabu in November 2005.[47] Madrids coach Wanderley Luxemburgo was sacked the following month and his replacement was Juan Ramn Lpez Caro.[48] A brief return to form came to an abrupt halt after losing the first leg of the Copa del Rey quarterfinal, 61 to Real Zaragoza.[49] Shortly after, Real Madrid were eliminated from the Champions League for a fourth successive year, this time at the hands of Arsenal. On 27 February 2006, Florentino Prez resigned.[50] Ramn Caldern was elected as club president on 2 July 2006 and subsequently appointed Fabio Capello as the new coach and Predrag Mijatovi as the new sporting director. Real Madrid won the Liga title in 2007 for the first time in four years, but Capello was nonetheless sacked at the end of the campaign.[51] On 9 June 2007, Real played against Zaragoza at La Romareda. Zaragoza led Real 21 near the end of the match while Barcelona were also winning against Espanyol 21. A late Ruud van Nistelrooy equalizer followed by a last-minute Ral Tamudo goal sprang Real Madrids title hopes back into their favour. The title was won on 17 June, where Real faced Mallorca at the Bernabu while Barcelona and Sevilla, the other title challengers, faced Gimnstic de Tarragona and Villarreal, respectively. At half-time, Real were 01 down, while Barcelona had surged ahead into a 03 lead in Tarragona; however, three goals in the last half-hour secured Madrid a 31 win and their first league title since 2003.[52] The first goal came from Jos Antonio Reyes, who scored after a good work from Gonzalo Higuan. An own goal followed by another goal from Reyes allowed Real to begin celebrating the title.[52] Thousands of Real Madrid fans began going to Plaza de Cibeles to celebrate the title.[52] On 1 June 2009, Florentino Prez regained Real Madrids presidency.[53] Prez continued with the Galcticos policy pursued in his first term, buying Kak from Milan for a record-breaking sum of 56 million,[54] and then breaking the record again by purchasing Cristiano Ronaldo from Manchester United for 80million.[55] Jos Mourinho took over as manager in May 2010.[56][57] In April 2011, a strange occurrence happened when, for the first time ever, four Clsicos were to be played in a span of just 18 days. The first fixture was for the Liga campaign on 17 April (which ended 11 with penalty goals for both sides), the Copa del Rey final (which ended 10 to Madrid) and the controversial two-legged Champions League semifinal on 27 April and 2 May (31 loss on aggregate) to Barcelona.[58] In the 201112 La Liga season, Real Madrid won La Liga for a record 32nd time in the leagues history, also finishing the season with numerous club-level records set, including 100 points reached in a single season, a total of 121 goals scored, a goal difference of +89 and 16 away wins, with 32 wins overall.[59] In the same season, Cristiano Ronaldo become the fastest player to reach 100 goals scored in Spanish league history. In reaching 101 goals in 92 games, Ronaldo surpassed Real Madrid legend Ferenc Pusks, who scored 100 goals in 105 games. Ronaldo set a new club mark for individual goals scored in one year (60), and became the first player ever to score against all 19 opposition teams in a single season.[60][61] Real Madrid began the 201213 season winning the Supercopa de Espaa, defeating Barcelona on away goals, but finished as second in the league competition. A major transfer of the season was signing from Tottenham Hotspur of Luka Modri for a fee in the region of 33million. In the Champions League, they were drawn in the group of death alongside Borussia Dortmund, Manchester City and Ajax, finishing second with three points behind Dortmund. In the round of 16, they defeated Manchester United, Galatasaray in the quarter-finals, and reached their third-straight semi-final finish in the Champions League, when they were again stopped by Dortmund. After a disappointing extra time loss to Atltico Madrid in the 2013 Copa del Rey Final, Prez announced the departure of Jos Mourinho at the end of the season by mutual agreement.[62][63] In the semi-finals we noticed the love from supporters in Marrakesh and it seemed like we were playing at home. That sums up the greatness of this team. Madrid is Gods team and the team of the world. On 25 June 2013, Carlo Ancelotti succeeded Mourinho to become the manager of Real Madrid on a three-year deal.[66] A day later, he was introduced at his first press conference for Madrid where it was announced that both Zinedine Zidane and Paul Clement will be his assistants.[67] On 1 September 2013, the long-awaited transfer from Tottenham of Gareth Bale was announced. The transfer of the Welshman was reportedly the new world record signing, with the transfer price approximated at 100million.[68] In Ancelottis first season at the club, Real Madrid won the Copa del Rey, with Bale scoring the winner in the final against Barcelona.[69] On 24 May, Real Madrid defeated city rivals Atltico Madrid in the 2014 Champions League Final, winning their first European title since 2002,[70] and becoming the first team to win ten European Cups/Champions League titles, an achievement known as La Dcima.[71] After winning the 2014 Champions League, Real Madrid signed goalkeeper Keylor Navas, midfielder Toni Kroos and attacking midfielder James Rodrguez.[72] The club won the 2014 UEFA Super Cup against Sevilla, the clubs 79th official trophy.[73] During the last week of the 2014 summer transfer window, Real Madrid sold two players key in the previous seasons successesXabi Alonso to Bayern Munich and ngel Di Mara to Manchester United. This decision from the club was surrounded by controversy, with Cristiano Ronaldo stating, If I was in charge, maybe I would have done things differently, while Carlo Ancelotti admitted, We must start again from zero.[74][75] After a slow start to the 201415 La Liga season, which included defeats to Atltico Madrid and Real Sociedad, Real Madrid went on a record-breaking 22-game winning streak, which included wins against Barcelona and Liverpool, surpassing the previous Spanish record of 18 successive wins set by Frank Rijkaards Bara in the 200506 season.[76] The streak came to an end in their opening game of 2015 with a loss to Valencia, leaving the club two short of equalling the world record of 24 consecutive wins.[77] The club failed to retain the Champions League (losing to Juventus in the semi-finals) and the Copa del Rey, and also failed to land the league title (finishing two points and a place behind champions Barcelona), shortcomings that all preceded Ancelottis sacking on 25 May 2015.[78] On 3 June 2015, Rafael Bentez was confirmed as the new Real Madrid manager, signing a three-year contract.[79] Real Madrid remained unbeaten in the league until a 32 loss at Sevilla in the 11th matchday. This was followed by a 04 home loss in the first Clsico of the season against Barcelona. In the Copa del Rey Round of 32, Real fielded an ineligible player in Denis Cheryshev in a 13 first leg win away against Cdiz, resulting in the second leg being cancelled and Real being disqualified.[80] Bentez was sacked on 4 January 2016, following allegations of unpopularity with supporters, displeasure with players and a failure to get good results against top sides.[81] At the time of sacking, Real were third in La Liga, four points behind leaders Atltico Madrid and two points behind arch-rivals Barcelona (with a game in hand).[82] On 4 January 2016, Bentezs departure was announced along with the promotion of Zinedine Zidane to his first head coaching role.[83] Zidane previously worked as assistant to Bentezs predecessor Carlo Ancelotti and, since 2014, had occupied the helm of reserve team Real Madrid Castilla.[83] Zidanes coaching debut for Madrid was marked by a 50 home victory over Deportivo in La Liga on 9 January 2016.[84] Under Zidane, Real ended up finishing in second place, just 1 point behind champions Barcelona, in the 201516 La Liga.[85] On 28 May, Real Madrid won their 11th Champions League title, extending their record for most successes in the competition, with the achievement being termed La Undcima.[86] Real began their 201617 campaign, which was to be Zidanes first full season in charge of Real Madrid, with a 32 win over Sevilla to claim the 2016 UEFA Super Cup.[87] On 10 December 2016, Madrid won 32 against Deportivo de La Corua, which was their 35th straight match without a loss, which set a new club record.[88] On 18 December 2016, Madrid defeated Japanese club Kashima Antlers 42 in the final of the 2016 FIFA Club World Cup.[89] With a 33 draw at Sevilla on 12 January 2017, Madrids unbeaten run extended to 40, breaking FC Barcelonas Spanish record of 39 games unbeaten in all competitions from the previous season.[90] Their unbeaten streak ended, following a 12 away loss against Sevilla in La Liga three days later.[91] In May that year, Madrid won the 201617 La Liga for a record 33rd time, their first in five years.[92] Coming in as defending champions, Real Madrid beat Napoli 62 on aggregate in the round of 16,[93][94] followed by a 63 aggregate win over Bayern in the quarter-finals,[95][96] and a 42 aggregate win over Atletico Madrid in the semi-finals.[97][98] The victory in the Champions League Final against Juventus resulted in Real Madrid being the first team to successfully defend their title in the Champions League era, and the first to win consecutive titles in the competition since A.C. Milan in 1989 and 1990, when the tournament was known as the European Cup. Real Madrids title was its 12th, extending its record, and its third in four years. The achievement is also known as La Duodcima.[99][100][101] The 201617 season was the greatest campaign in terms of trophies won in the history of Real Madrid, as the club attained four titles, a feat previously never achieved by Real.[102]    1902 1908 1920 1931 1941 The first crest had a simple design consisting of a decorative interlacing of the three initials of the club, MCF for Madrid Club de Ftbol, in dark blue on a white shirt. The first change in the crest occurred in 1908 when the letters adopted a more streamlined form and appeared inside a circle.[105] The next change in the configuration of the crest did not occur until the presidency of Pedro Parages in 1920. At that time, King Alfonso XIII granted the club his royal patronage which came in the form of the title Real Madrid, meaning Royal.[106] Thus, Alfonsos crown was added to the crest and the club styled itself Real Madrid Club de Ftbol.[105] With the dissolution of the monarchy in 1931, all the royal symbols (the crown on the crest and the title of Real) were eliminated. The crown was replaced by the dark mulberry band of the Region of Castile.[22] In 1941, two years after the end of the Civil War, the crests Real Corona, or Royal Crown, was restored while the mulberry stripe of Castile was retained as well.[28] In addition, the whole crest was made full color, with gold being the most prominent, and the club was again called Real Madrid Club de Ftbol.[105] The most recent modification to the crest occurred in 2001 when the club wanted to better situate itself for the 21st century and further standardize its crest. One of the modifications made was changing the mulberry stripe to a more bluish shade.[105] Real Madrids traditional home colours are all white, although before its foundation, in the clubs first game against themselves, they adopted a blue and a red oblique stripe on the shirt to differentiate the two teams (the club crest design has a purple stripe which is not associated to this. It was incorporated the year they lost the royal crown, as it the traditional region of Castile colour); but unlike today, black socks were worn. Lastly, the black socks will be replaced by dark blue ones.[21][107] Real Madrid has maintained the white shirt for its home kit throughout the history of the club. There was, however, one season that the shirt and shorts were not both white. It was an initiative undertaken by Escobal and Quesada in 1925; the two were traveling through England when they noticed the kit worn by London-based team Corinthian F.C., one of the most famous teams at the time known for its elegance and sportsmanship. It was decided that Real Madrid would wear black shorts in an attempt to replicate the English team, but the initiative lasted just one year. After being eliminated from the cup by Barcelona with a 15 defeat in Madrid and a 20 defeat in Catalonia, President Parages decided to return to an all-white kit, claiming that the other kit brought bad luck.[108] By the early 1940s, the manager changed the kit again by adding buttons to the shirt and the clubs crest on the left breast, which has remained ever since. On 23 November 1947, in a game against Atltico Madrid at the Metropolitano Stadium, Real Madrid became the first Spanish team to wear numbered shirts.[28] English club Leeds United permanently switched their blue shirt for a white one in the 1960s, to emulate the dominant Real Madrid of the era.[109] Reals traditional away colours are all blue or all purple. Since the advent of the replica kit market, the club has also released various other one colour designs, including red, green, orange and black. The clubs kit is manufactured by Adidas, whose contract extends from 1998.[110][111] Real Madrids first shirt sponsor, Zanussi, agreed for the 198283, 198384 and 198485 seasons. Following that, the club was sponsored by Parmalat and Otaysa before a long-term deal was signed with Teka in 1992.[112][113] In 2001, Real Madrid ended their contract with Teka and for one season and used the Realmadrid.com logo to promote the clubs website. Then, in 2002, a deal was signed with Siemens Mobile and in 2006, the BenQ Siemens logo appeared on the clubs shirt.[114] Real Madrids shirt sponsor from 2007 until 2013 was bwin.com following the economic problems of BenQ Siemens.[115][116] It is currently Fly Emirates. After moving between grounds, the team moved to the Campo de ODonnell in 1912, which remained its home ground for 11 years.[19] After this period, the club moved for one year to the Campo de Ciudad Lineal, a small ground with a capacity of 8,000spectators. After that, Real Madrid moved its home matches to Estadio Chamartn, which was inaugurated on 17 May 1923 with a match against Newcastle United.[118] In this stadium, which hosted 22,500spectators, Real Madrid celebrated its first Spanish league title.[21] After some successes, the 1943 elected president Santiago Bernabu decided that the Estadio Chamartn was not big enough for the ambitions of the club, and thus a new stadium was built and was inaugurated on 14 December 1947.[28][119] This was the Santiago Bernabu Stadium as it is known today, although it did not acquire the present name until 1955.[29] The first match at the Bernabu was played between Real Madrid and the Portuguese club Belenenses and won by Los Blancos, 31, the first goal being scored by Sabino Barinaga.[28] The capacity has changed frequently, peaking at 120,000 after a 1953 expansion.[120] Since then, there have been a number of reductions due to modernizations (the last standing places went away in 199899 in response to UEFA regulations which forbids standing at matches in the UEFA competition), countered to some extent by expansions.[120] The latest capacity is 81,044 spectators. A plan to add a retractable roof has been announced.[119] Real Madrid has the fourth-highest of the average attendances of European football clubs, behind only Borussia Dortmund, Barcelona and Manchester United.[121][122][123][124] The Bernabu has hosted the 1964 European Championship final, the 1982 FIFA World Cup final, the 1957, 1969 and 1980 European Cup finals and the 2010 Champions League Final.[125] The stadium has its own Madrid Metro station along the 10 line called Santiago Bernabu.[126] On 14 November 2007, the Bernabu has been upgraded to Elite Football Stadium status by UEFA.[127] On 9 May 2006, the Alfredo Di Stfano Stadium was inaugurated in the City of Madrid, where Real Madrid usually trains. The inaugural match was played between Real Madrid and Stade Reims, a rematch of the 1956 European Cup final. Real Madrid won the match 61 with goals from Sergio Ramos, Antonio Cassano (2), Roberto Soldado (2) and Jos Manuel Jurado. The venue is now part of the Ciudad Real Madrid, the clubs new training facilities located outside Madrid in Valdebebas. The stadium holds 5,000 people and is Real Madrid Castillas home ground. It is named after former Real legend Alfredo Di Stfano.[128] Ral holds the record for most Real Madrid appearances, having played 741first-team matches from 1994 to 2010. Iker Casillas comes second with 725appearances, followed by Manuel Sanchis, Jr., having played 710times.[129] The record for a goalkeeper is held by Iker Casillas, with 725appearances. With166* caps (162 while at the club), he is also Reals most capped international player while with127 caps (47 while at the club). Cristiano Ronaldo is Real Madrids all-time top goalscorer, with 406 goals.[130][131] Five other players have also scored over 200 goals for Real: Alfredo Di Stfano (195364), Santillana (197188), Ferenc Pusks (195866), Hugo Snchez (198592) and the previous goalscoring record-holder Ral (19942010). Cristiano Ronaldo also holds the record for the most league goals scored in one season (48 in 201415), alongside being Reals top goalscorer of all time in La Liga history with 285 goals. Di Stfanos 49goals in 58matches was for decades the all-time highest tally in the European Cup, until it was surpassed by Ral in 2005, which now is held by Cristiano Ronaldo with 105 goals. The fastest goal in the history of the club (12 seconds) was scored by the Brazilian Ronaldo on 3 December 2003 during a league match against Atltico Madrid.[132] Officially, the highest home attendance figure for a Real Madrid match is 83,329, which was for a football cup competition, the Copa del Rey, in 2006. The current legal capacity of the Santiago Bernabu is 80,354.[133] The clubs average attendance in 200708 season was 76,234, the highest in European Leagues.[134] Real has also set records in Spanish football, most notably the most domestic titles (32 as of 201213) and the most seasons won in a row (five, during 196065 and 198590).[1] With 121 matches (from 17 February 1957 to 7 March 1965), the club holds the record for longest unbeaten run at home in La Liga.[135] The club also hold the record for winning the European Cup/UEFA Champions League eleven times[136] and for the most semi-final appearances (27). As of April 2016, Cristiano Ronaldo is the all-time top scorer in the UEFA Champions League, with 98goals in total, 82 while playing for Real Madrid. The team has the record number of consecutive participations in the European Cup (before it became the Champions League) with 15, from 195556 to 196970.[137] Among the clubs on-field records is a 22-game winning streak in all competitions during the 201415 season, a Spanish record and fourth worldwide.[138] The same season the team tied the win-streak for games in the Champions League, with ten.[139] As of April 2017, holds the Spanish record of consecutive matches scoring in a row with 53, second best in European history.[140] In June 2009, the club broke its own record for the highest transfer fee ever paid in the history of football by agreeing to pay Manchester United 96million (US$131.5million, 80million) for the services of Cristiano Ronaldo.[141][142] The fee of 76million (over $100million, 45.8million) for Zinedine Zidanes transfer from Juventus to Real Madrid in 2001 was the previous highest transfer fee ever paid. This record had been broken previously in June 2009, for a few days, when Real Madrid agreed to buy Kak from Milan. The transfer of Tottenham Hotspurs Gareth Bale in 2013 was reportedly the new world record signing, with the transfer price expected at around 100 million.[68] In January 2016, documents pertaining to Bales transfer were leaked which confirmed a world record transfer fee of 100,759,418.[143] The clubs sale record came on 26 August 2014, when Manchester United signed ngel Di Mara for 75million.[144] During most home matches the majority of the seats in the stadium are occupied by season ticket holders, of which the figure is capped at 65,000.[145] To become a season ticket holder one must first be a socio, or club member. In addition to members, the club has more than 1,800peas (official, club-affiliated supporters groups) in Spain and around the world. Real Madrid has the second highest average all-time attendance in Spanish football and regularly attracts over 74,000 fans to the Bernabu. One of the best supported teams globally, Real Madrid was the first sports team (and first brand) to reach 100 million fans on Facebook in April 2017.[146][147] Real Madrids hardcore supporters are the so-called Ultras Sur supporters, or simply Ultras. They are known for their extreme right-wing politics, akin to Barcelonas hardcore supporters group Boixos Nois. The Ultras Surs have developed an alliance with other right wing groups, most notably Lazio Irriducibili fans, and have also developed an alliance with left-wing groups. On several occasions, they have racially abused opposing players and have been investigated by UEFA for doing so.[148][149] Florentino Prez took it upon himself to ban the Ultras from the Bernabu and assign their seats to the general public. This decision was controversial with some of the Bernabu faithful, however, as the lively atmosphere of games would suffer as a result.[150][151] The Ultras have since held protests outside the Bernabu and have demanded to be reinstated and allowed to enter the grounds.[152] There is often a fierce rivalry between the two strongest teams in a national league, and this is particularly the case in La Liga, where the game between Real Madrid and Barcelona is known as The Classic (El Clsico). From the start of national competitions, the clubs were seen as representatives of two rival regions in Spain, Catalonia and Castile, as well as of the two cities. The rivalry reflects what many regard as the political and cultural tensions felt between Catalans and the Castilians, seen by one author as a re-enactment of the Spanish Civil War.[153] Over the years, the record from Real Madrid and Barcelona is 81 victories for Madrid, 76 victories for Barcelona, and 39 draws.[154] During the dictatorships of Primo de Rivera and especially of Francisco Franco (19391975), all regional cultures were suppressed. All of the languages spoken in Spanish territory, except Spanish (Castilian) itself, were officially banned.[155][156] Symbolising the Catalan peoples desire for freedom, Barcelona became More than a club (Ms que un club) for the Catalans. According to Manuel Vzquez Montalbn, the best way for the Catalans to demonstrate their identity was by joining Barcelona. It was less risky than joining a clandestine anti-Franco movement, and allowed them to express their dissidence.[157] On the other hand, Real Madrid was widely seen as the embodiment of the sovereign oppressive centralism and the fascist regime at management level and beyond Santiago Bernabu, the former club president for whom Real Madrids stadium is named, fought on the Nationalist side during the Spanish Civil War.[158][159] During the war, however, members of both clubs, such as Josep Sunyol and Rafael Snchez Guerra, suffered at the hands of Francoists. During the 1950s, the rivalry was exacerbated further when there was a controversy surrounding the transfer of Alfredo Di Stfano, who finally played for Real Madrid and was key to their subsequent success.[160] The 1960s saw the rivalry reach the European stage when they met twice in a controversial knock-out round of the European Cup, with Madrid receiving unfavourable treatment from the referee.[161][162] In 2002, the European encounter between the clubs was dubbed the Match of The Century by Spanish media, and Madrids win was watched by more than 500 million people.[163] The clubs nearest neighbour is Atltico Madrid, a rivalry being shared between fans of both football teams. Although Atltico was founded by three Basque students in 1903, it was joined in 1904 by dissident members of Madrid FC. Tensions escalated further after Atltico were merged with the football team of the Spanish airforce (and thus renamed Atltico Aviacin), and in the 1940s, Atltico was perceived as the preferred team of Francos regime before he revelled in Reals European success in the 1950s.[164][165] Furthermore, Real supporters initially came from the middle and upper classes while the Atltico supporters were drawn from the working class. Today, however, these distinctions are largely blurred. They met for the first time on 21 February 1929 in matchday three of the first League Championship at the former Chamartn. It was the first official derby of the new tournament, and Real won 21.[21] The rivalry first gained international attention in 1959 during the European Cup when the two clubs met in the semi-final. Real won the first leg 21 at the Bernabu while Atltico won 10 at the Metropolitano. The tie went to a replay, which Real won 21. Atltico, however, gained some revenge when, led by former Real Madrid coach Jos Villalonga, it defeated its city rivals in two successive Copa del Generalsimo finals in 1960 and 1961.[166] Between 1961 and 1989, when Real dominated La Liga, only Atltico offered it any serious challenge, winning Liga titles in 1966, 1970, 1973 and 1977. In 1965, Atltico became the first team to beat Real at the Bernabu in eight years. Real Madrids record against Atltico in more recent times is very favorable.[167] A high point coming in the 200203 season, when Real clinched the La Liga title after a 04 victory at Atltico at the Vicente Caldern Stadium. Atlticos first win over its city rivals since 1999 came with the Copa del Rey win in May 2013. In 201314, Real and Atltico were finalists of UEFA Champions League, the first final which hosted two clubs from same city. Real Madrid triumphed with 41 in extra time.[168] On 7 February 2015, Real suffered their first defeat in 14 years at the Vicente Caldern, a 40 loss.[169] On 28 May 2016, Real and Atltico met again for the Champions League title in Milan which resulted in a win for Real Madrid via Penalty Shootout.[170] Real Madrid and Bayern Munich are two of the most successful clubs in the UEFA Champions League/European Cup competition, Real winning twelve times and Bayern winning five times. Real Madrid versus Bayern is the match that has historically been played most often in the Champions League/European Cup with 24 matches (11 wins each, with 2 draws).[171] Reals biggest loss at home in the Champions League came at the hands of Bayern on 29 February 2000, 24.[172] Real Madrid supporters often refer to Bayern as the Bestia negra (Black Beast). In recent years, the two teams met in the 201112 Champions League semi-finals, which resulted in 33 on aggregate (Bayern won 31 on penalties after added extra time), then in the 201314 UEFA Champions League semi-finals with Real Madrid winning 50 on aggregate (and going on to win the finals of the competition),[173] and again in the 201617 UEFA Champions League quarter-finals, with Real Madrid winning 63 on aggregate, and subsequently winning that seasons Champions League.[171] It was under Florentino Prezs first presidency (20002006) that Real Madrid started its ambition of becoming the worlds richest professional football club.[174] The club ceded part of its training grounds to the city of Madrid in 2001, and sold the rest to four corporations: Repsol YPF, Mutua Automovilstica de Madrid, Sacyr Vallehermoso and OHL. The sale eradicated the clubs debts, paving the way for it to buy the worlds most expensive players, such as Zinedine Zidane, Lus Figo, Ronaldo and David Beckham. The city had previously rezoned the training grounds for development, a move which in turn increased their value, and then bought the site.[42] The European Commission started an investigation into whether the city overpaid for the property, to be considered a form of state subsidy.[175] The sale of the training ground for office buildings cleared Real Madrids debts of 270 million and enabled the club to embark upon an unprecedented spending spree which brought big-name players to the club. In addition, profit from the sale was spent on a state-of-the-art training complex on the citys outskirts.[176] Although Prezs policy resulted in increased financial success from the exploitation of the clubs high marketing potential around the world, especially in Asia, it came under increasing criticism for being too focused on marketing the Real Madrid brand and not enough on the performances of the team.[45] By September 2007, Real Madrid was considered the most valuable football brand in Europe by BBDO. In 2008, it was ranked the second-most valuable club in football, with a value of 951 million (640million / $1.285billion),[177] only beaten by Manchester United, which was valued at 1.333 billion (900 million).[178] In 2010, Real Madrid had the highest turnover in football worldwide.[179] In September 2009, Real Madrids management announced plans to open its own dedicated theme park by 2013.[180] A study at Harvard University concluded that Real Madrid is one of the 20 most important brand names and the only one in which its executives, the players, are well-known. We have some spectacular figures in regard to worldwide support of the club. There are an estimated 287 million people worldwide who follow Real Madrid.[181] In 2010, Forbes evaluated Real Madrids worth to be around 992 million (US$1.323 billion), ranking them second after Manchester United, based on figures from the 200809 season.[182][183] According to Deloitte, Real Madrid had a recorded revenue of 401 million in the same period, ranking first.[184] Along with Barcelona, Athletic Bilbao and Osasuna, Real Madrid is organised as a registered association. This means that Real Madrid is owned by its supporters who elect the club president. The club president cannot invest his own money into the club[185] and the club can only spend what it earns, which is mainly derived through merchandise sales, television rights and ticket sales. Unlike a limited company, it is not possible to purchase shares in the club, but only membership.[186] The members of Real Madrid, called socios, form an assembly of delegates which is the highest governing body of the club.[187] As of 2010, the club has 60,000 socios.[188] At the end of the 200910 season, the clubs board of directors stated that Real Madrid had a net debt of 244.6 million, 82.1 million lower than the previous fiscal year. Real Madrid announced that it had a net debt of 170 million after the 201011 season. From 2007 to 2011, the club made a net profit of 190 million.[189][190] During the 200910 season, Real Madrid made 150 million through ticket sales, which was the highest in top-flight football.[189] The club has the highest number of shirt sales a season, around 1.5 million.[189] For the 201011 season its wage bill totalled 169 million, which was second-highest in Europe behind Barcelona.[191] However, its wage bill to turnover ratio was the best in Europe at 43 percent, ahead of Manchester United and Arsenal at 46 percent and 50 percent, respectively. In 2013, Forbes listed the club as the worlds most valuable sports team, worth $3.3billion.[7] Real Madrid was the featured club in the second edition of the Goal! football movie trilogy, Goal! 2: Living the Dream... (2007). The film follows former Newcastle United star Santiago Muez as he is first scouted, and then signed by Real Madrid for the 200506 season. The films creators wanted to put emphasis on the changes in Muezs life after his move to Madrid. Production was done with the full support of UEFA, allowing the film crew to use many real life players in cameo roles. Real Madrid squad members featured in the film included Iker Casillas, Zinedine Zidane, David Beckham, Ronaldo, Roberto Carlos, Ral, Sergio Ramos, Robinho, Michael Owen, Mchel Salgado, Jlio Baptista, Steve McManaman and Ivn Helguera. Non-Real Madrid players to make cameo appearances included Ronaldinho, Thierry Henry, Lionel Messi, Samuel Etoo, Andrs Iniesta, Pablo Aimar, Fredrik Ljungberg, Cesc Fbregas and Santiago Caizares. In the film, both Florentino Prez and Alfredo Di Stfano presented the fictional player Muez to the club after his signing.[192] Real, The Movie is a 2005 part feature, part documentary film that showcases the worldwide passion for Real Madrid C.F. Produced by the club and directed by Borja Manso, it follows five sub-stories of fans from around the world and their love for Real Madrid. Along with the fictional portion of the film, it also contains real footage of the squad, during training at Ciudad Real Madrid, matches, and interviews. Although the film mentions all of the squad, it mainly focuses on galcticos such as David Beckham, Zinedine Zidane, Ral, Lus Figo, Ronaldo, Iker Casillas, and Roberto Carlos, among others. The film was originally produced in Spanish, but has been dubbed for their worldwide fanbase. The book White Storm: 100 years of Real Madrid by Phil Ball was the first English-language history of Real Madrid. Published in 2002, it talks about the most successful moments of the club during its first centenary, having been translated into various languages. In late 2011, Real Madrid released a digital music album, entitled Legends, and a remix of the clubs anthem, Himno del Real Madrid, was released as the first single from the album.[193] Real Madrid TV is an encrypted digital television channel, operated by Real Madrid and specialising in the club. The channel is available in Spanish and English. It is located at Ciudad Real Madrid in Valdebebas (Madrid), Real Madrids training centre. Hala Madrid is a magazine published quarterly for the Real Madrid club members and the Madridistas Fan Club card holders.[194] The phrase Hala Madrid, meaning Forward Madrid or Go Madrid, is also the title of the clubs official anthem, which is often sung by the Madridistas (the clubs fans).[195] The magazine includes reports on the clubs matches in the previous month, as well as information about the reserve and youth teams. Features often include interviews with players, both past and present, and the clubs historic matches.[194] Spanish teams are limited to three players without EU citizenship. The squad list includes only the principal nationality of each player; several non-European players on the squad have dual citizenship with an EU country. Also, players from the ACP countriescountries in Africa, the Caribbean, and the Pacific that are signatories to the Cotonou Agreementare not counted against non-EU quotas due to the Kolpak ruling.

(Catalan pronunciation:[fubb kub brson](listen)), commonly known as Barcelona and familiarly as Bara,[note 1] is a professional football club based in Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain. Founded in 1899 by a group of Swiss, English and Catalan footballers led by Joan Gamper, the club has become a symbol of Catalan culture and Catalanism, hence the motto Ms que un club (English: More than a club). Unlike many other football clubs, the supporters own and operate Barcelona. It is the second most valuable sports team in the world, worth $3.56billion, and the worlds second richest football club in terms of revenue, with an annual turnover of 560.8million.[2][3] The official Barcelona anthem is the Cant del Bara, written by Jaume Picas and Josep Maria Espins.[4] Domestically, Barcelona has won 24 La Liga, 29 Copa del Rey, 12 Supercopa de Espaa, 3 Copa Eva Duarte and 2 Copa de la Liga trophies, as well as being the record holder for the latter four competitions. In international club football, Barcelona has won twenty European and World titles  four UEFA Champions League titles and one European Cup, a record four UEFA Cup Winners Cup, a shared record five UEFA Super Cup, a record three Inter-Cities Fairs Cup and a record three FIFA Club World Cup.[5] Barcelona was ranked first in the IFFHS Club World Ranking for 1997, 2009, 2011, 2012 and 2015[6][7] and currently occupies the third position on the UEFA club rankings.[8] The club has a long-standing rivalry with Real Madrid; matches between the two teams are referred to as El Clsico. Barcelona is one of the most widely supported teams in the world, and the club has one of the largest social media following in the world among sports teams.[9][10] Barcelona players have won a record number of Ballon dOr awards (11), with recipients including Johan Cruyff, as well as a record number of FIFA World Player of the Year awards (7), with winners including Ronaldo, Romrio and Ronaldinho. In 2010, three players who came through the clubs youth academy (Lionel Messi, Andrs Iniesta and Xavi) were chosen as the three best players in the world in the FIFA Ballon dOr awards, an unprecedented feat for players from the same football school. Barcelona is one of three founding members of the Primera Divisin that have never been relegated from the top division, along with Athletic Bilbao and Real Madrid. In 2009, Barcelona became the first Spanish club to win the continental treble consisting of La Liga, Copa del Rey, and the UEFA Champions League, and also became the first Spanish football club to win six out of six competitions in a single year, by also winning the Spanish Super Cup, UEFA Super Cup and FIFA Club World Cup.[11] In 2011, the club became European champions again and won five trophies. This Barcelona team, which won 14 trophies in just 4 years under Pep Guardiola, is considered by some in the sport to be the greatest team of all time.[12][13][14] By winning their fifth Champions League trophy on 6 June 2015, Barcelona became the first European club in history to achieve the continental treble twice.   On 22 October 1899, Hans Gamper placed an advertisement in Los Deportes declaring his wish to form a football club; a positive response resulted in a meeting at the Gimnasio Sol on 29 November. Eleven players attended  Walter Wild (the first director of the club), Llus dOss, Bartomeu Terradas, Otto Kunzle, Otto Maier, Enric Ducal, Pere Cabot, Carles Pujol, Josep Llobet, John Parsons, and William Parsons  and Foot-Ball Club Barcelona was born.[16] FC Barcelona had a successful start in regional and national cups, competing in the Campionat de Catalunya and the Copa del Rey. In 1902, the club won its first trophy, the Copa Macaya, and participated in the first Copa del Rey, losing 12 to Bizcaya in the final.[17] In 1908, Hans Gamper  now known as Joan Gamper  became club president in a desperate attempt to save Barcelona from extinction, finding the club struggling not just on the pitch, but also financially and socially, after not winning a competition since the Campionat de Catalunya in 1905. He said in a meeting, Barcelona cannot die and must not die. If there is nobody who is going to try, then I will assume the responsibility of running the club from now on.[18] Club president on five separate occasions between 1908 and 1925, he spent 25 years in total at the helm. One of his main achievements was ensuring Bara acquire its own stadium and thus generate a stable income.[19] On 14 March 1909, the team moved into the Camp de la Indstria, a stadium with a capacity of 8,000. To celebrate their new surroundings, the club conducted a logo contest the following year. Carles Comamala won the contest, and his suggestion became the crest that the club still wears  with some minor changes  as of the present day.[20] With the new stadium, Barcelona participated in the inaugural version of the Pyrenees Cup, which, at the time, consisted of the best teams of Languedoc, Midi and Aquitaine (Southern France), the Basque Country and Catalonia; all were former members of the Marca Hispanica region. The contest was the most prestigious in that era.[21] From the inaugural year in 1910 to 1913, Barcelona won the competition four consecutive times. Carles Comamala played an integral part of the four-time champion, managing the side along with Amechazurra and Jack Greenwell. The latter became the clubs first full-time coach in 1917.[22] The last edition was held in 1914 in the city of Barcelona, which local rivals Espanyol won.[23] During the same period, the club changed its official language from Castilian to Catalan and gradually evolved into an important symbol of Catalan identity. For many fans, participating in the club had less to do with the game itself and more with being a part of the clubs collective identity.[24] On 4 February 1917, the club held its first testimonial match to honour Ramn Torralba, who played from 1913 to 1928. The match was against local side Terrassa: Barcelona won 62.[25] Gamper simultaneously launched a campaign to recruit more club members, and by 1922, the club had more than 20,000, who helped finance a new stadium. The club then moved to the new Les Cortes, which they inaugurated the same year.[26] Les Cortes had an initial capacity of 30,000, and in the 1940s it was expanded to 60,000.[27] Gamper recruited Jack Greenwell as the first full-time manager in Barcelonas history. After this hiring, the clubs fortunes began to improve on the field. During the Gamper-led era, Barcelona won eleven Campionats de Catalunya, six Copa del Rey and four Pyrenees Cups and enjoyed its first golden age.[17][19] On 14 June 1925, in a spontaneous reaction against Primo de Riveras dictatorship, the crowd in the stadium jeered the Royal March. As a reprisal, the ground was closed for six months and Gamper was forced to relinquish the presidency of the club.[28] This coincided with the transition to professional football, and, in 1926, the directors of Barcelona publicly claimed, for the first time, to operate a professional football club.[26] On 3 July 1927, the club held a second testimonial match for Paulino Alcntara, against the Spanish national team. To kick off the match, local journalist and pilot Josep Canudas dropped the ball onto the pitch from his aeroplane.[25] In 1928, victory in the Spanish Cup was celebrated with a poem titled Oda a Platko, which was written by a member of the Generation of 27, Rafael Alberti, inspired by the heroic performance of the Barcelona goalkeeper, Franz Platko.[29] On 23 June 1929, Barcelona won the inaugural Spanish League. A year after winning the championship, on 30 July 1930, Gamper committed suicide after a period of depression brought on by personal and financial problems.[19] Although they continued to have players of the standing of Josep Escol, the club now entered a period of decline, in which political conflict overshadowed sports throughout society. Attendance at matches dropped as the citizens of Barcelona were occupied with discussing political matters.[30] Although the team won the Campionat de Catalunya in 1930, 1931, 1932, 1934, 1936 and 1938,[17] success at a national level (with the exception of the 1937 disputed title) evaded them. A month after the Spanish Civil War began in 1936, several players from Barcelona enlisted in the ranks of those who fought against the military uprising, along with players from Athletic Bilbao.[31] On 6 August, Falangist soldiers near Guadarrama murdered club president Josep Sunyol, a representative of the pro-independence political party.[32] He was dubbed the martyr of barcelonisme, and his murder was a defining moment in the history of FC Barcelona and Catalan identity.[33] In the summer of 1937, the squad was on tour in Mexico and the United States, where it was received as an ambassador of the Second Spanish Republic. The tour led to the financial security of the club, but also resulted in half of the team seeking asylum in Mexico and France, making it harder for the remaining team to contest for trophies.[34][35] On 16 March 1938, Barcelona came under aerial bombardment from the Italian Air Force, causing more than 3,000 deaths, with one of the bombs hitting the clubs offices.[36][37] A few months later, Catalonia came under occupation and as a symbol of the undisciplined Catalanism, the club, now down to just 3,486 members, faced a number of restrictions. All signs of regional nationalism, including language, flag and other signs of separatism were banned throughout Spain. The Catalan flag was banned and the club were prohibited from using non-Spanish names. These measures forced the club to change its name to Club de Ftbol Barcelona and to remove the Catalan flag from its crest.[38] In 1943, Barcelona faced rivals Real Madrid in the semi-finals of Copa del Generalsimo (now the Copa del Rey). The first match at Les Corts was won by Barcelona 30. Real Madrid comfortably won the second leg, beating Barcelona 111.[39] According to football writer Sid Lowe, There have been relatively few mentions of the game [since] and it is not a result that has been particularly celebrated in Madrid. Indeed, the 111 occupies a far more prominent place in Barcelonas history. This was the game that first formed the identification of Madrid as the team of the dictatorship and Barcelona as its victims.[40] It has been alleged by local journalist Paco Aguilar that Barcelonas players were threatened by police in the changing room, though nothing was ever proven.[41] Despite the difficult political situation, CF Barcelona enjoyed considerable success during the 1940s and 1950s. In 1945, with Josep Samitier as coach and players like Csar, Ramallets and Velasco, they won La Liga for the first time since 1929. They added two more titles in 1948 and 1949.[42] In 1949, they also won the first Copa Latina.[43] In June 1950, Barcelona signed Lszl Kubala, who was to be an important figure at the club.[44] On a rainy Sunday of 1951, the crowd left Les Corts stadium after a 21 win against Santander by foot, refusing to catch any trams, and surprising the Francoist authorities. The reason was simple: at the same time, a tram strike was taking place in Barcelona, receiving the support of blaugrana fans. Events like this made CF Barcelona represent much more than just Catalonia and many progressive Spaniards saw the club as a staunch defender of rights and freedoms.[45][46] Coach Ferdinand Dauk and Lszl Kubala led the team to five different trophies including La Liga, the Copa del Generalsimo, the Copa Latina, the Copa Eva Duarte, and the Copa Martini Rossi in 1952. In 1953, the club won La Liga and the Copa del Generalsimo again.[27] With Helenio Herrera as coach, a young Luis Surez, the European Footballer of the Year in 1960, and two influential Hungarians recommended by Kubala, Sndor Kocsis and Zoltn Czibor, the team won another national double in 1959 and a La Liga and Fairs Cup double in 1960. In 1961, they became the first club to beat Real Madrid in a European Cup play-off. However, they lost 23 to Benfica in the final.[47][48] The 1960s were less successful for the club, with Real Madrid monopolising La Liga. The completion of the Camp Nou, finished in 1957, meant the club had little money to spend on new players.[48] The 1960s saw the emergence of Josep Maria Fust and Carles Rexach, and the club won the Copa del Generalsimo in 1963 and the Fairs Cup in 1966. Barcelona restored some pride by beating Real Madrid 10 in the 1968 Copa del Generalsimo final at the Santiago Bernabu in front of Francisco Franco, with coach Salvador Artigas, a former republican pilot in the Civil War. With the end of Francos dictatorship in 1974, the club changed its official name back to Futbol Club Barcelona and reverted the crest to its original design, including the original letters once again.[49][50] The 197374 season saw the arrival of Johan Cruyff, who was bought for a world record 920,000 from Ajax.[51] Already an established player with Ajax, Cruyff quickly won over the Barcelona fans when he told the European press that he chose Barcelona over Real Madrid because he could not play for a club associated with Francisco Franco. He further endeared himself when he named his son Jordi, after the local Catalan Saint George.[52] Next to champions like Juan Manuel Asensi, Carles Rexach and Hugo Sotil, he helped the club win the 197374 season for the first time since 1960,[17] defeating Real Madrid 50 at the Santiago Bernabu en route. He was crowned European Footballer of the Year in 1973 during his first season with Barcelona (his second Ballon dOr win; he won his first while playing for Ajax in 1971). Cruyff received this prestigious award a third time (the first player to do so) in 1974, while he was still with Barcelona.[53] In 1978, Josep Llus Nez became the first elected president of FC Barcelona, and, since then, the members of Barcelona have elected the club president. The process of electing a president of FC Barcelona was closely tied to Spains transition to democracy in 1974 and the end of Francos dictatorship. The new presidents main objective was to develop Barcelona into a world-class club by giving it stability both on and off the pitch. His presidency was to last for 22 years, and it deeply affected the image of Barcelona, as Nez held to a strict policy regarding wages and discipline, letting go of such players as Diego Maradona, Romrio and Ronaldo rather than meeting their demands.[56][57] On 16 May 1979, the club won its first European Cup Winners Cup by beating Fortuna Dsseldorf 43 in Basel in a final watched by more than 30,000 travelling blaugrana fans. The same year, Nez began to invest in the clubs youth programme by converting La Masia into a dormitory for young academy players from abroad. The name of the dormitory would later become synonymous with the youth programme of Barcelona.[58] In June 1982, Diego Maradona was signed for a world record fee of 5million from Boca Juniors.[59] In the following season, under coach Csar Luis Menotti, Barcelona won the Copa del Rey, beating Real Madrid. Maradonas time with Barcelona, however, was short-lived and he soon left for Napoli. At the start of the 198485 season, Terry Venables was hired as manager and he won La Liga with noteworthy displays by German midfielder Bernd Schuster. The next season, he took the team to their second European Cup final, only to lose on penalties to Steaua Bucureti during a dramatic evening in Seville.[56] Around this time, tensions began to arise between what was perceived as president Nezs dictatorial rule and the nationalistic support group, Boixos Nois. The group, identified with a left-wing separatism, repeatedly demanded the resignation of Nez and openly defied him through chants and banners at matches. At the same time, Barcelona experienced an eruption in skinheads, who often identified with a right-wing separatism. The skinheads slowly transferred the Boixos Nois ideology from liberalism to fascism, which caused division within the group and a sudden support for Nezs presidency.[60] Inspired by British hooligans, the remaining Boixos Nois became violent, causing havoc leading to large-scale arrests.[61] After the 1986 FIFA World Cup, Barcelona signed the English top-scorer Gary Lineker, along with goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta, but the team could not achieve success, as Schuster was excluded from the team. Terry Venables was subsequently fired at the beginning of the 198788 season and replaced with Luis Aragons. The season finished with the players rebelling against president Nez, in an event known as the Hesperia mutiny, and a 10 victory in the Copa del Rey final against Real Sociedad.[56] In 1988, Johan Cruyff returned to the club as manager and he assembled the so-called Dream Team.[62] He used a mix of Spanish players like Pep Guardiola, Jos Mari Bakero and Txiki Begiristain while signing international players such as Ronald Koeman, Michael Laudrup, Romrio and Hristo Stoichkov.[63]  It was ten years after the inception of the youth programme, La Masia, when the young players began to graduate and play for their first team. One of the first graduates, who would later earn international acclaim, was previous Barcelona coach Pep Guardiola.[64] Under Cruyffs guidance, Barcelona won four consecutive La Liga titles from 1991 to 1994. They beat Sampdoria in both the 1989 UEFA Cup Winners Cup final and the 1992 European Cup final at Wembley, with a free kick goal from Dutch international Ronald Koeman. They also won a Copa del Rey in 1990, the European Super Cup in 1992 and three Supercopa de Espaa trophies. With 11 trophies, Cruyff became the clubs most successful manager at that point. He also became the clubs longest consecutive serving manager, serving eight years.[65] Cruyffs fortune was to change, and, in his final two seasons, he failed to win any trophies and fell out with president Josep Llus Nez, resulting in his departure.[56] On the legacy of Cruyffs football philosophy and the passing style of play he introduced to the club, future coach of Barcelona Pep Guardiola would state, Cruyff built the cathedral, our job is to maintain and renovate it.[66] Reacting to Cruyffs departure, an independent protest group was organised by Armand Caraben, Joan Laporta and Alfons Godall.[67] The objective of the group, called LElefant Blau, was to oppose the presidency of Nez, which they regarded as a corruption of the clubs traditional values.[67][68] Laporta would later take over the presidency of Barcelona in 2003.[69] Cruyff was briefly replaced by Bobby Robson, who took charge of the club for a single season in 199697. He recruited Ronaldo from his previous club, PSV and delivered a cup treble, winning the Copa del Rey, UEFA Cup Winners Cup and the Supercopa de Espaa. Despite his success, Robson was only ever seen as a short-term solution while the club waited for Louis van Gaal to become available.[70] Like Maradona, Ronaldo only stayed a short time before he left for Internazionale. However, new heroes emerged, such as Lus Figo, Patrick Kluivert, Luis Enrique and Rivaldo, and the team won a Copa del Rey and La Liga double in 1998. In 1999, the club celebrated its centenari, winning the Primera Divisin title, and Rivaldo became the fourth Barcelona player to be awarded European Footballer of the Year. Despite this domestic success, the failure to emulate Real Madrid in the Champions League led to van Gaal and Nez resigning in 2000.[70] The departures of Nez and Van Gaal were hardly noticed by the fans when compared to that of Lus Figo, then club vice-captain. Figo had become a cult hero and was considered by Catalans to be one of their own. Barcelona fans, however, were distraught by Figos decision to join arch-rivals Real Madrid, and, during subsequent visits to the Camp Nou, Figo was given an extremely hostile reception. Upon his first return, a piglets head and a full bottle of whiskey were thrown at him from the crowd.[73] The next three years saw the club in decline, and managers came and went. Van Gaal was replaced by Lorenzo Serra Ferrer who, despite an extensive investment in players in the summer of 2000, presided over a mediocre league campaign and a humiliating first-round Champions League exit, and was eventually dismissed late in the season. Long-serving coach Carles Rexach was appointed as his replacement, initially on a temporary basis, and managed to at least steer the club to the last Champions League spot on the final day of the season. Despite better form in La Liga and a good run to the semi-finals of the Champions League, Rexach was never viewed as a long-term solution and that summer Van Gaal returned to the club for a second spell as manager. What followed, despite another decent Champions League performance, was one of the worst La Liga campaigns in the clubs history, with the team as low as 15th in February 2003. This led to Van Gaals resignation and replacement for the rest of the campaign by Radomir Anti, though a sixth-place finish was the best that he could manage. At the end of the season, Antis short-term contract was not renewed, and club president Joan Gaspart resigned, his position having been made completely untenable by such a disastrous season on top of the clubs overall decline in fortunes since he became president three years prior.[74]  After the disappointment of the Gaspart era, the combination of a new young president, Joan Laporta, and a young new manager, former Dutch and Milan star Frank Rijkaard, saw the club bounce back. On the field, an influx of international players, including Ronaldinho, Deco, Henrik Larsson, Ludovic Giuly, Samuel Etoo, and Rafael Mrquez, combined with home grown Spanish players, such as Carles Puyol, Andrs Iniesta, Xavi and Vctor Valds, led to the clubs return to success. Barcelona won La Liga and the Supercopa de Espaa in 200405, and Ronaldinho and Etoo were voted first and third, respectively, in the FIFA World Player of the Year awards.[75] In the 200506 season, Barcelona repeated their league and Supercopa successes. The pinnacle of the league season arrived at the Santiago Bernabu in a 30 win over Real Madrid. It was Rijkaards second victory at the Bernabu, making him the first Barcelona manager to win there twice. Ronaldinhos performance was so impressive that after his second goal, which was Barcelonas third, some Real Madrid fans gave him a standing ovation.[76] In the Champions League, Barcelona beat the English club Arsenal in the final. Trailing 10 to a ten-man Arsenal and with less than 15 minutes remaining, they came back to win 21, with substitute Henrik Larsson, in his final appearance for the club, setting up goals for Samuel Etoo and fellow substitute Juliano Belletti, for the clubs first European Cup victory in 14 years.[77] Despite being the favourites and starting strongly, Barcelona finished the 200607 season without trophies. A pre-season US tour was later blamed for a string of injuries to key players, including leading scorer Etoo and rising star Lionel Messi. There was open feuding as Etoo publicly criticised coach Rijkaard and Ronaldinho.[78] Ronaldinho also admitted that a lack of fitness affected his form.[79] In La Liga, Barcelona were in first place for much of the season, but inconsistency in the New Year saw Real Madrid overtake them to become champions. Barcelona advanced to the semi-finals of the Copa del Rey, winning the first leg against Getafe 52, with a goal from Messi bringing comparison to Diego Maradonas goal of the century, but then lost the second leg 40. They took part in the 2006 FIFA Club World Cup, but were beaten by a late goal in the final against Brazilian side Internacional.[80] In the Champions League, Barcelona were knocked out of the competition in the last 16 by eventual runners-up Liverpool on away goals. Barcelona finished the 200708 season third in La Liga and reached the semi-finals of the UEFA Champions League and Copa del Rey, both times losing to the eventual champions, Manchester United and Valencia, respectively. The day after a 41 defeat to Real Madrid, Joan Laporta announced that Barcelona B coach Pep Guardiola would take over Frank Rijkaards duties on 30 June 2008.[81]  Barcelona B youth manager Pep Guardiola took over Frank Rijkaards duties at the conclusion of the season.[81] Guardiola brought with him the now famous tiki-taka style of play he had been taught during his time in the Barcelona youth teams. In the process, Guardiola sold Ronaldinho and Deco and started building the Barcelona team around Xavi, Andrs Iniesta and Lionel Messi. Bara beat Athletic Bilbao 41 in the 2009 Copa del Rey final, winning the competition for a record-breaking 25th time. A historic 26 victory against Real Madrid followed three days later and ensured that Barcelona became 200809 La Liga champions. Bara finished the season by beating the previous years Champions League winners Manchester United 20 at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome to win their third Champions League title and completed the first ever treble won by a Spanish team.[83][84][85] The team went on to win the 2009 Supercopa de Espaa against Athletic Bilbao[86] and the 2009 UEFA Super Cup against Shakhtar Donetsk,[87] becoming the first European club to win both domestic and European Super Cups following a treble. In December 2009, Barcelona won the 2009 Club World Cup.[88] Barcelona accomplished two new records in Spanish football in 2010 as they retained the La Liga trophy with 99 points and won the Supercopa de Espaa for a ninth time.[89][90]  After Laportas departure from the club in June 2010, Sandro Rosell was soon elected as the new president. The elections were held on 13 June, where he got 61.35 (57,088 votes, a record) of total votes.[91] Rosell signed David Villa from Valencia for 40million[92] and Javier Mascherano from Liverpool for 19million.[93] At the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, Barcelona players that had graduated from the clubs La Masia youth system would play a major role in Spain becoming world champions. On 11 July, seven players who came through the academy participated in the final, six of which were Barcelona players whom started the match, with Iniesta scoring the winning goal against the Netherlands.[94] In November 2010, Barcelona defeated their main rival, Real Madrid 50 in El Clsico. In the 201011 season, Barcelona retained the La Liga trophy, their third title in succession, finishing with 96 points.[95] In April 2011, the club reached the Copa del Rey final, losing 10 to Real Madrid at the Mestalla Stadium in Valencia.[96] In May, Barcelona defeated Manchester United in the 2011 Champions League final 31 held at Wembley Stadium, a repeat of the 2009 final, winning their fourth European Cup.[97] In August 2011, La Masia graduate Cesc Fbregas was bought from Arsenal and he would help Barcelona defend the Spanish Supercup against Real Madrid. The Supercup victory brought the total number of official trophies to 73, matching the number of titles won by Real Madrid.[98] Later the same month, Barcelona won the UEFA Super Cup after defeating Porto 20 thanks to goals from Lionel Messi and Cesc Fbregas. This extended the clubs overall number of official trophies to 74, surpassing Real Madrids total amount of official trophies.[99] The Super Cup victory also marked another impressive achievement as Pep Guardiola won his 12th trophy out of 15 possible in only three years at the helm of the club, becoming the all-time record holder of most titles won as a coach at Barcelona.[100] In December, Barcelona won the Club World Cup for a record second time since its establishment, after defeating 2011 Copa Libertadores holders Santos 40 in the final thanks to two goals from Messi and goals from Xavi and Fbregas.[101] As a result, the overall trophy title during the reign of Guardiola was further extended and saw Barcelona win their 13th trophy out of 24 possible in four years, continuing their high-quality performance in recent world football competitions.[102][103] In the 201112 season, Barcelona lost the semi-finals of the Champions League against Chelsea. Right afterward, coach Guardiola, who had been on a rolling contract and had faced criticism over his recent tactics and squad selections,[104][105] announced that he would step down as manager on 30 June and be succeeded by assistant Tito Vilanova.[106][107] Guardiola finished his tenure with Bara winning the Copa del Rey final 30, bringing the tally to 14 trophies that Bara had won under his coaching.[108] It was announced in summer of 2012 that Tito Vilanova, assistant manager at Barcelona, would take over from Pep Guardiola as manager. Following his appointment, Barcelona went on an incredible run that saw them hold the top spot on the league table for the entire season, recording only two losses and amassing 100 points. Their top scorer once again was Lionel Messi, who scored 46 goals in La Liga, including two hat-tricks. On 11 May 2013, Barcelona were crowned as the Spanish football champions for the 22nd time, still with four games left to play. Ultimately, Barcelona ended the season 15 points clear of rivals Real Madrid, despite losing 21 to them at the beginning of March.[109] They reached the semifinal stage of both the Copa del Rey and the Champions League, going out to Real Madrid and Bayern Munich respectively. On 19 July, it was announced that Vilanova was resigning as Barcelona manager because his throat cancer had returned, and he would be receiving treatment for the second time after a three-month medical leave in December 2012.[110] On 22 July 2013, Gerardo Tata Martino was confirmed as manager of Barcelona for the 201314 season.[111] Barcelonas first official games under Martino were the home and away legs of the 2013 Supercopa de Espaa, which Bara won 11 on away goals. On 23 January 2014, Sandro Rosell resigned as president by the admissibility of the complaint for alleged misappropriation following the transfer of Neymar. Josep Maria Bartomeu replaced him to finish the term in 2016. In April 2014, FIFA banned the club from buying players for the next two transfer windows following the violation of the FIFAs rules about the transfer of footballers aged under 18.[112] A statement on FIFAs website read, With regard to the case in question, FC Barcelona has been found to be in breach of art. 19 of the Regulations in the case of ten minor players and to have committed several other concurrent infringements in the context of other players, including under Annexe 2 of the Regulations. The Disciplinary Committee regarded the infringements as serious and decided to sanction the club with a transfer ban at both national and international level for two complete and consecutive transfer periods, together with a fine of CHF 450,000. Additionally, the club was granted a period of 90 days in which to regularise the situation of all minor players concerned.[113] FIFA rejected an appeal in August but the pending appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport allowed Barcelona to sign players during the summer of 2014.[114] On 17 May, in a game where they needed to defeat Atltico Madrid (who had eliminated them from the Champions League in the quarter-finals earlier in the year) to be crowned champions of La Liga for the 23rd time, they drew after Atltico defender Diego Godn headed in the equaliser in the 49th minute, giving Atltico the championship.[115] Two days later, it was announced that Luis Enrique would return to Barcelona as head coach, after he agreed to a two-year deal. He was recommended by sporting director Andoni Zubizarreta, his former national teammate.[116][117] Following Enriques arrival, Barcelona broke their transfer record when they paid Liverpool between 81 to 94million for striker Luis Surez,[118][119] who was serving a four-month ban from all football-related activity imposed by the FIFA Disciplinary Committee after biting Italian defender Giorgio Chiellini during his appearance for Uruguay in a World Cup group stage match.[120][121][122]  In late December, Barcelonas appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport was unsuccessful and the original transfer ban was reinstated, leaving the club unable to utilise the 2015 winter and summer transfer windows.[114] On 5 January 2015, Zubizareta was sacked by the board after four years as director of football.[123] The next month, Barcelona announced the formation of a new Football Area Technical Commission, made up of vice-president Jordi Mestre, board member Javier Bordas, Carles Rexach and Ariedo Braida.[124] Barcelona won the treble in the 201415 season, winning La Liga, Copa del Rey and Champions League titles, and became the first European team to have won the treble twice.[125] On 17 May, the club clinched their 23rd La Liga title after defeating Atltico Madrid.[126] This was Barcelonas seventh La Liga title in the last ten years.[127] On 30 May, the club defeated Athletic Bilbao in the Copa del Rey final at Camp Nou.[128] On 6 June, Barcelona won the Champions League final with a 31 win against Juventus, which completed the treble, the clubs second in six years.[129] Barcelonas attacking trio of Messi, Surez and Neymar, dubbed MSN, scored 122 goals in all competitions, the most in a season for an attacking trio in Spanish football history.[130] On 11 August, Barcelona started the 201516 season winning a joint record fifth European Super Cup by beating Sevilla 54 in the 2015 UEFA Super Cup. They ended the year with a 30 win over Argentine club River Plate in the 2015 Club World Cup final on 20 December to win the trophy for a record third time, with Surez, Messi and Iniesta the top three players of the tournament.[131] The Club World Cup was Barcelonas 20th international title, a record only matched by Egyptian club Al Ahly.[132][133] By scoring 180 goals in 2015 in all competitions, Barcelona set the record for most goals scored in a calendar year, breaking Real Madrids record of 178 goals scored in 2014.[134] On 4 January 2016, Barcelonas transfer ban ended. The same day, they registered 77 players across all categories and ages, and both last summer signings Arda Turan and Aleix Vidal became eligible to play with the first team.[135] On 10 February, qualifying for the sixth Copa del Rey final in the last eight seasons, Luis Enriques Barcelona broke the clubs record of 28 consecutive games unbeaten in all competitions set by Guardiolas team in the 201011 season, with a 11 draw with Valencia in the second leg of the 201516 Copa del Rey.[136][137] With a 51 win at Rayo Vallecano on 3 March, Barcelonas 35th match unbeaten, the club broke Real Madrids Spanish record of 34 games unbeaten in all competitions from the 19881989 season.[138][139] After Bara reached 39 matches unbeaten, the run has ended on 2 April 2016 with a 21 defeat to Real Madrid at Camp Nou.[140] On 14 May 2016, Barcelona won their sixth La Liga title in eight seasons with a 30 win in the final day of the season at Granada.[141] On 8 March 2017, Barcelona made the largest comeback in Champions League history in the 2016-17 UEFA Champions League in 2nd Leg, beating Paris Saint-Germain by a score of 61 (aggregate score 65), despite losing the first leg in France by a score of 40.[142] The nickname cul for a Barcelona supporter is derived from the Catalan cul (English: arse), as the spectators at the first stadium, Camp de la Indstria, sat with their culs over the stand. In Spain, about 25 of the population is said to be Bara sympathisers, second behind Real Madrid, supported by 32 of the population.[143] Throughout Europe, Barcelona is the favourite second-choice club.[144] The clubs membership figures have seen a significant increase from 100,000 in the 200304 season to 170,000 in September 2009,[145] the sharp rise being attributed to the influence of Ronaldinho and then-president Joan Laportas media strategy that focused on Spanish and English online media.[146][147] In addition to membership, as of 2015[update] there are 1,267 officially registered fan clubs, called penyes, around the world.[148] The fan clubs promote Barcelona in their locality and receive beneficial offers when visiting Barcelona.[149] Among the best supported teams globally, Barcelona has the second highest social media following in the world among sports teams, with over 100million Facebook fans as of April 2017, just behind Real Madrid.[9][150][151] The club has had many prominent people among its supporters, including Pope John Paul II, who was an honorary member, and former prime minister of Spain Jos Luis Rodrguez Zapatero.[152][153] Barcelona has the second highest average attendance of European football clubs only behind Borussia Dortmund.[154][155] There is often a fierce rivalry between the two strongest teams in a national league, and this is particularly the case in La Liga, where the game between Barcelona and Real Madrid is known as El Clsico. From the start of national competitions the clubs were seen as representatives of two rival regions in Spain: Catalonia and Castile, as well as of the two cities. The rivalry reflects what many regard as the political and cultural tensions felt between Catalans and the Castilians, seen by one author as a re-enactment of the Spanish Civil War.[156] During the dictatorships of Miguel Primo de Rivera (19231930) and especially of Francisco Franco (19391975), all regional cultures were suppressed. All of the languages spoken in Spanish territory, except Spanish (Castilian) itself, were officially banned.[157][158] Symbolising the Catalan peoples desire for freedom, Bara became More than a club (Ms que un club) for the Catalans. According to Manuel Vzquez Montalbn, the best way for the Catalans to demonstrate their identity was by joining Bara. It was less risky than joining a clandestine anti-Franco movement, and allowed them to express their dissidence.[159] During Francos regime, however, the blaugrana team was granted profit due to its good relationship with the dictator at management level, even giving two awards to him.[160] On the other hand, Real Madrid was widely seen as the embodiment of the sovereign oppressive centralism and the fascist regime at management level and beyond: Santiago Bernabu, the former club president for whom their stadium is named, fought on the Nationalist side during the Spanish Civil War.[161][162] During the Spanish Civil War, however, members of both clubs such as Josep Sunyol and Rafael Snchez Guerra suffered at the hands of Franco supporters. During the 1950s, the rivalry was exacerbated further when there was a controversy surrounding the transfer of Alfredo Di Stfano, who finally played for Real Madrid and was key to their subsequent success.[163] The 1960s saw the rivalry reach the European stage when they met twice in a controversial knock-out round of the European Cup, with Madrid receiving unfavourable treatment from the referee,[164][165] In 2002, the European encounter between the clubs was dubbed the Match of The Century by Spanish media, and Madrids win was watched by more than 500million people.[166] Baras local rival has always been Espanyol. Blanc-i-blaus, being one of the clubs granted royal patronage, was founded exclusively by Spanish football fans, unlike the multinational nature of Baras primary board. The founding message of the club was clearly anti-Barcelona, and they disapprovingly saw FC Barcelona as a team of foreigners.[167] The rivalry was strengthened by what Catalonians saw as a provocative representative of Madrid.[168] Their original ground was in the affluent district of Sarri.[169][170] Traditionally, Espanyol was seen by the vast majority of Barcelonas citizens as a club which cultivated a kind of compliance to the central authority, in stark contrast to Baras revolutionary spirit.[171] Also in the 1960s and 1970s, while FC Barcelona acted as an integrating force for Catalonias new arrivals from poorer regions of Spain expecting to find a better life, Espanyol drew their support mainly from sectors close to the regime such as policemen, military officers, civil servants and career fascists.[172] In 1918, Espanyol started a counter-petition against autonomy, which at that time had become a pertinent issue.[167] Later on, an Espanyol supporter group would join the Falangists in the Spanish Civil War, siding with the fascists. Despite these differences in ideology, the derbi has always been more relevant to Espanyol supporters than Barcelona ones due to the difference in objectives. In recent years the rivalry has become less political, as Espanyol translated its official name and anthem from Spanish to Catalan.[167] Though it is the most played local derby in the history of La Liga, it is also the most unbalanced, with Barcelona overwhelmingly dominant. In the primera divisin league table, Espanyol has only managed to end above Bara on three occasions from 81 seasons (19282016) and the only all-Catalan Copa del Rey final was won by Bara in 1957. Espanyol has the consolation of achieving the largest margin win with a 60 in 1951, while Barcelonas biggest win was 50 on six occasions (in 1933, 1947, 1964, 1975, 1992 and 2016). Espanyol achieved a 21 win against Bara during the 200809 season, becoming the first team to defeat Barcelona at Camp Nou in their treble-winning season.[173] Barcelonas rival in European football is Italian club A.C. Milan.[174][175][176][177] The team against which Barcelona has played the most matches (19), it is also the second most played match in European competitions, tied with Real Madrid - Juventus and both after Real Madrid - Bayern Munich (24).[178][179] Two of the most successful clubs in Europe, Milan has won seven European Cups to Baras five, while both clubs have won a record five European Super Cups.[180] Barcelona and Milan have won other continental titles, which make them the second and third most decorated teams in world football, with 20 and 18 titles respectively, both behind Real Madrids 21.[181] Barcelona leads the Head-To-Head record with eight wins and five defeats. The first encounter between the two clubs was in the 195960 European Cup. They faced off in the round of 16 and Bara won the tie on a 71 aggregate score (02 in Milan and 51 in Barcelona).[182] While Milan had never knocked Barcelona out of the European Cup, theyve beaten Johan Cruyffs Dream Team 40 in the 1994 Champions League final, despite being the underdogs.[183][184] In 2013, however, Barcelona made a historic comeback from a 02 first leg defeat in the round of 16 of the 201213 Champions League, winning 40 at the Camp Nou.[185][186] Along with Real Madrid, Athletic Bilbao and Osasuna, Barcelona is organised as a registered association. Unlike a limited company, it is not possible to purchase shares in the club, but only membership.[187] The members of Barcelona, called socis, form an assembly of delegates which is the highest governing body of the club.[188] As of 2016[update] the club has 140,000 socis.[189] In 2010, Forbes evaluated Barcelonas worth to be around 752million (US$1billion), ranking them fourth after Manchester United, Real Madrid and Arsenal, based on figures from the 200809 season.[190][191] According to Deloitte, Barcelona had a recorded revenue of 366million in the same period, ranking second to Real Madrid, who generated 401 million in revenue.[192] In 2013, Forbes magazine ranked Barcelona the third most valuable sports team in the world, behind Real Madrid and Manchester United, with a value of $2.6billion.[193] In 2014, Forbes ranked them the second most valuable sports team in the world, worth $3.2billion, and Deloitte ranked them the worlds fourth richest football club in terms of revenue, with an annual turnover of 484.6million.[3][194] Xavi presently holds the team record for most number of total games played (767) and the record number of La Liga appearances (505), Andrs Iniesta comes second with 630 in all competitions and 412 in the League. Barcelonas all-time highest goalscorer in all competitions (including friendlies) is Lionel Messi with 539 goals, surpassing Paulino Alcntaras record (369 goals) held for 87 years,[195] as well as being the highest goalscorer in official competitions with 507 goals. He is also the record goalscorer for Barcelona in European (97 goals) and international club competitions (102 goals), and the record league scorer with 349 goals in La Liga. Alongside Messi, three other players have managed to score over 100 league goals at Barcelona: Csar (190), Lszl Kubala (131) and Samuel Etoo (108). Josep Samitier is the clubs highest goalscorer in the Copa del Rey, with 65 goals. Lszl Kubala holds La Liga record of most goals scored in one match, with seven goals against Sporting de Gijn in 1952.[196] Lionel Messi, with five goals against Bayer Leverkusen in 2012, has the Champions League record alongside Luiz Adriano.[197] Eulogio Martnez became Baras top goalscorer in a cup game, when he scored seven goals against Atltico Madrid in 1957. Barcelona goalkeepers have won a record number of Zamora trophies (20), with Antoni Ramallets and Vctor Valds winning a record five each. Valds had a ratio of 0.832 goals-conceded-per-game, a La Liga record,[198] and he also holds the record for longest period without conceding a goal (896 minutes) in all competitions for Barcelona.[199] Claudio Bravo has the record of best unbeaten start in a season in La Liga history (754 minutes).[200][201] Barcelonas longest serving manager is Jack Greenwell, with nine years in two spells (19171924) and (19311933), and Pep Guardiola is the clubs most successful manager (14 trophies in 4 years). The most successful Barcelona players are Andrs Iniesta and Messi (30 trophies), surpassing Xavi (25 trophies).[202] Barcelonas Camp Nou is the largest stadium in Europe. The clubs highest home attendance was 120,000 in a European Cup quarter-final against Juventus on 3 March 1986.[203] The modernisation of Camp Nou during the 1990s and the introduction of all-seater stands means the record will not be broken for the foreseeable future as the current capacity of the stadium is 99,354.[204] El Bara de les Cinc Copes is the first team in Spanish football to have won five trophies in a single season (19511952).[205][206][207] Barcelona is the only club to have played in every season of European competitions since they started in 1955 counting non-UEFA competition Inter Cities Fair Cup.[208][209] On 18 December 2009, alongside being the only Spanish club to achieve the continental treble, Barcelona became the first ever football team to complete the sextuple.[210][211] On July 2014, Barcelona signed Luis Surez from Liverpool for about 75million, the highest transfer fee in club history without considering Neymars one which after spanish courts investigations, still in progress, raised up to more than 83million.[212][213][214] In 2016, the club set a Spanish record for most consecutive games unbeaten in all competitions (39).[138] One year later the record was broken by Real Madrid (40).[215][216] Barcelonas La Masia is ranked by the International Centre for Sports Studies (CIES) as the second academy that produces more top-level players than any other academy in the world just behind Real Madrid.[217] The clubs original crest was a quartered diamond-shaped crest topped by the Crown of Aragon and the bat of King James, and surrounded by two branches, one of a laurel tree and the other a palm.[20] In 1910, the club held a competition among its members to design a new crest. The winner was Carles Comamala, who at the time played for the club. Comamalas suggestion became the crest that the club wears today, with some minor variations. The crest consists of the St George Cross in the upper-left corner with the Catalan flag beside it, and the team colours at the bottom.[20] The blue and red colours of the shirt were first worn in a match against Hispania in 1900.[219] Several competing theories have been put forth for the blue and red design of the Barcelona shirt. The son of the first president, Arthur Witty, claimed it was the idea of his father as the colours were the same as the Merchant Taylors School team. Another explanation, according to author Toni Strubell, is that the colours are from Robespierres First Republic. In Catalonia the common perception is that the colours were chosen by Joan Gamper and are those of his home team, FC Basel.[220] The clubs most frequently used change colours have been yellow and orange. An away kit featuring the red and yellow stripes of the flag of Catalonia has also been used. Prior to the 20112012 season, Barcelona had a long history of avoiding corporate sponsorship on the playing shirts. On 14 July 2006, the club announced a five-year agreement with UNICEF, which includes having the UNICEF logo on their shirts. The agreement had the club donate 1.5million per year to UNICEF (0.7 of its ordinary income, equal to the UN International Aid Target, cf. ODA) via the FC Barcelona Foundation.[224] The FC Barcelona Foundation is an entity set up in 1994 on the suggestion of then-chairman of the Economical-Statutory Committee, Jaime Gil-Aluja. The idea was to set up a foundation that could attract financial sponsorships to support a non-profit sport company.[225] In 2004, a company could become one of 25 Honorary members by contributing between 40,00060,000 (55,40083,100)[226] per year. There are also 48 associate memberships available for an annual fee of 14,000 (19,400)[226] and an unlimited number of patronages for the cost of 4,000 per year (5,500).[226] It is unclear whether the honorary members have any formal say in club policy, but according to the author Anthony King, it is unlikely that Honorary Membership would not involve at least some informal influence over the club.[227] Barcelona ended their refusal of corporate sponsorship prior to the commencement of the 201112 season, signing a five-year, 150 million deal with Qatar Sports Investments, that meant the Qatar Foundation[228] was on the clubs shirt for the 201112 and 201213 seasons, then replaced by Qatar Airways for the 201314 season, the deal allowing for a commercial sponsor logo to replace the charity logo, two years into the six-year deal.[229] The deal with Qatar Airways was extended for one more year in 2016.[230] Barcelona initially played in the Camp de la Indstria. The capacity was about 6,000, and club officials deemed the facilities inadequate for a club with growing membership.[231] In 1922, the number of supporters had surpassed 20,000 and by lending money to the club, Bara was able to build the larger Camp de Les Corts, which had an initial capacity of 20,000 spectators. After the Spanish Civil War the club started attracting more members and a larger number of spectators at matches. This led to several expansion projects: the grandstand in 1944, the southern stand in 1946, and finally the northern stand in 1950. After the last expansion, Les Corts could hold 60,000 spectators.[232] After the construction was complete there was no further room for expansion at Les Corts. Back-to-back La Liga titles in 1948 and 1949 and the signing of Lszl Kubala in June 1950, who would later go on to score 196 goals in 256 matches, drew larger crowds to the games.[232][233][234] The club began to make plans for a new stadium.[232] The building of Camp Nou commenced on 28 March 1954, before a crowd of 60,000 Bara fans. The first stone of the future stadium was laid in place under the auspices of Governor Felipe Acedo Colunga and with the blessing of Archbishop of Barcelona Gregorio Modrego. Construction took three years and ended on 24 September 1957 with a final cost of 288 million pesetas, 336 over budget.[232] In 1980, when the stadium was in need of redesign to meet UEFA criteria, the club raised money by offering supporters the opportunity to inscribe their name on the bricks for a small fee. The idea was popular with supporters, and thousands of people paid the fee. Later this became the centre of controversy when media in Madrid picked up reports that one of the stones was inscribed with the name of long-time Real Madrid chairman and Franco supporter Santiago Bernabu.[235][236][237] In preparation for the 1992 Summer Olympics two tiers of seating were installed above the previous roofline.[238] It has a current capacity of 99,354 making it the largest stadium in Europe.[1] There are also other facilities, which include:[239] Spanish teams are limited to three players without EU citizenship. The squad list includes only the principal nationality of each player; several non-European players on the squad have dual citizenship with an EU country. Also, players from the ACP countriescountries in Africa, the Caribbean, and the Pacific that are signatories to the Cotonou Agreementare not counted against non-EU quotas due to the Kolpak ruling. Note: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules. Players may hold more than one non-FIFA nationality.

is a football club in Manchester, England. Founded in 1880 as St. Marks (West Gorton), they became Ardwick Association Football Club in 1887 and Manchester City in 1894. The club moved to the City of Manchester Stadium in 2003, having played at Maine Road since 1923. The clubs most successful period was in the late 1960s and early 1970s when they won the League Championship, FA Cup, League Cup and European Cup Winners Cup under the management team of Joe Mercer and Malcolm Allison. After losing the 1981 FA Cup Final, the club went through a period of decline, culminating in relegation to the third tier of English football for the only time in their history in 1998. Having regained their Premier League status in the early 2000s, the club was purchased in 2008 by Abu Dhabi United Group and has become one of the wealthiest in the world. Since 2011 the club have won five major honours, including the Premier League in 2012 and 2014. By 201516, Manchester City had the fifth-highest revenue in the footballing world with an annual revenue of 463.5 million.[3] In 2016, Forbes magazine estimated they were the worlds sixth most valuable football club, worth $1.92 billion.[4]   City gained their first honours by winning the Second Division in 1899; with it came promotion to the highest level in English football, the First Division. They went on to claim their first major honour on 23 April 1904, beating Bolton Wanderers 10 at Crystal Palace to win the FA Cup; City narrowly missed out on a League and Cup double that season after finishing runners-up in the League but City became the first club in Manchester to win a major honour.[6] In the seasons following the FA Cup triumph, the club was dogged by allegations of financial irregularities, culminating in the suspension of seventeen players in 1906, including captain Billy Meredith, who subsequently moved across town to Manchester United.[7] A fire at Hyde Road destroyed the main stand in 1920, and in 1923 the club moved to their new purpose-built stadium at Maine Road in Moss Side.[8] In the 1930s, Manchester City reached two consecutive FA Cup finals, losing to Everton in 1933, before claiming the Cup by beating Portsmouth in 1934.[9] During the 1934 cup run, Manchester City broke the record for the highest home attendance of any club in English football history, as 84,569 fans packed Maine Road for a sixth round FA Cup tie against Stoke City in 1934  a record which still stands to this day.[10] The club won the First Division title for the first time in 1937, but were relegated the following season, despite scoring more goals than any other team in the division.[11] Twenty years later, a City team inspired by a tactical system known as the Revie Plan reached consecutive FA Cup finals again, in 1955 and 1956; just as in the 1930s, they lost the first one, to Newcastle United, and won the second. The 1956 final, in which Manchester City beat Birmingham City 31, is one of the most famous finals of all-time, and is remembered for City goalkeeper Bert Trautmann continuing to play on after unknowingly breaking his neck.[12] After relegation to the Second Division in 1963, the future looked bleak with a record low home attendance of 8,015 against Swindon Town in January 1965.[13] In the summer of 1965, the management team of Joe Mercer and Malcolm Allison was appointed. In the first season under Mercer, City won the Second Division title and made important signings in Mike Summerbee and Colin Bell.[14] Two seasons later, in 196768, Manchester City claimed the League Championship for the second time, clinching the title on the final day of the season with a 43 win at Newcastle United and beating their close neighbours Manchester United into second place.[15] Further trophies followed: City won the FA Cup in 1969, before achieving European success by winning the European Cup Winners Cup in 1970, beating Grnik Zabrze 21 in Vienna.[16] City also won the League Cup that season, becoming the second English team to win a European trophy and a domestic trophy in the same season. The club continued to challenge for honours throughout the 1970s, finishing one point behind the league champions on two occasions and reaching the final of the 1974 League Cup.[17] One of the matches from this period that is most fondly remembered by supporters of Manchester City is the final match of the 197374 season against arch-rivals Manchester United, who needed to win to have any hope of avoiding relegation. Former United player Denis Law scored with a backheel to give City a 10 win at Old Trafford and confirm the relegation of their rivals.[18][19] The final trophy of the clubs most successful period was won in 1976, when Newcastle United were beaten 21 in the League Cup final. A long period of decline followed the success of the 1960s and 1970s. Malcolm Allison rejoined the club to become manager for the second time in 1979, but squandered large sums of money on unsuccessful signings, such as Steve Daley.[20] A succession of managers then followed  seven in the 1980s alone. Under John Bond, City reached the 1981 FA Cup final but lost in a replay to Tottenham Hotspur. The club were twice relegated from the top flight in the 1980s (in 1983 and 1987), but returned to the top flight again in 1989 and finished fifth in 1991 and 1992 under the management of Peter Reid.[21] However, this was only a temporary respite, and following Reids departure Manchester Citys fortunes continued to fade. City were co-founders of the Premier League upon its creation in 1992, but after finishing ninth in its first season they endured three seasons of struggle before being relegated in 1996. After two seasons in Division One, City fell to the lowest point in their history, becoming the second ever European trophy winners to be relegated to their countrys third league tier, after 1. FC Magdeburg of Germany. After relegation, the club underwent off-the-field upheaval, with new chairman David Bernstein introducing greater fiscal discipline.[22] Under manager Joe Royle, City were promoted at the first attempt, achieved in dramatic fashion in a play-off against Gillingham. A second successive promotion saw City return to the top division, but this proved to have been a step too far for the recovering club, and in 2001 City were relegated once more. Kevin Keegan replaced Royle as manager in the close season, and achieved an immediate return to the top division as the club won the 200102 Division One championship, breaking club records for the number of points gained and goals scored in a season in the process.[23] The 200203 season was the last at Maine Road, and included a 31 derby victory over rivals Manchester United, ending a run of 13 years without a derby win.[24] City also qualified for European competition for the first time in 25 years. In the 2003 close season the club moved to the new City of Manchester Stadium. The first four seasons at the stadium all resulted in mid-table finishes. Former England manager Sven-Gran Eriksson became the clubs first manager from overseas when appointed in 2007.[25] After a bright start performances faded in the second half of the season, and Eriksson was sacked in June 2008.[26] Eriksson was replaced by Mark Hughes two days later on 4 June 2008.[27] By 2008, the club was in a financially precarious position. Thaksin Shinawatra had taken control of the club a year before, but his political travails saw his assets frozen.[28] Then, in August 2008, the club was purchased by the Abu Dhabi United Group. The takeover was immediately followed by a flurry of bids for high-profile players; the club broke the British transfer record by signing Brazilian international Robinho from Real Madrid for 32.5million.[29] Performances were not a huge improvement on the previous season despite the influx of money however, with the team finishing tenth, although they did well to reach the quarter-finals of the UEFA Cup. During the summer of 2009, the club took transfer spending to an unprecedented level, with an outlay of over 100million on players Gareth Barry, Roque Santa Cruz, Kolo Tour, Emmanuel Adebayor, Carlos Tevez and Joleon Lescott.[30] In December 2009, Mark Hughes  who had been hired shortly before the change in ownership but was originally retained by the new board  was replaced as manager by Roberto Mancini.[31] City finished the season in fifth position in the Premier League, narrowly missing out on a place in the Champions League, and competed in the UEFA Europa League in season 201011. Continued investment in players followed in successive seasons, and results began to match the upturn in player quality. City reached the 2011 FA Cup Final, their first major final in over thirty years, after defeating derby rivals Manchester United in the semi-final,[32] the first time they had knocked their rival out of a cup competition since 1975. They defeated Stoke City 10 in the final, securing their fifth FA Cup, the clubs first major trophy since winning the 1976 League Cup. In the same week, the club qualified for the UEFA Champions League for the first time since 1968 with a 10 Premier League win over Tottenham Hotspur.[33] On the last day of the 201011 season, City passed Arsenal for third place in the Premier League, thereby securing qualification directly into the Champions League group stage. Strong performances continued to follow in the 201112 season, with the club beginning the following season in commanding form, including beating Tottenham 51 at White Hart Lane and humbling Manchester United by a 61 scoreline in Uniteds own stadium. Although the strong form waned halfway through the season, and City at one point fell eight points behind their arch rivals with only six games left to play, a slump by United allowed the blue side of Manchester to draw back level with two games to go, setting up a thrilling finale to the season with both teams going into the last day equal on points. Despite City only needing a home win against a team in the relegation zone, they fell a goal behind by the end of normal time, leading some of Uniteds players to finish their game celebrating in the belief that they had won the league. Two goals in injury time  including one scored almost five minutes after normal time had elapsed  resulted in an almost-literal last-minute title victory, Citys first in 44 years, and became only the fifth team to win the Premier League since its creation in 1992. In the aftermath that followed, the event was described by media sources from the UK and around the world as the greatest moment in Premier League history.[34][35] The game was also notable for former player Joey Bartons sending off, where he committed three separate red card-able incidents on three different players in the space of only a couple of seconds, resulting in a 12-game ban.[36] The following season City failed to capitalise on the gains made in the first two full seasons of Mancinis reign. While City rarely seemed likely to drop below second in the table, they posed little title challenge all season. In the UEFA Champions League, the club was eliminated at the group stage for a second successive season, while a second FA Cup final in three seasons ended in a 10 defeat to relegated Wigan Athletic.[37] Mancini was dismissed two days later, ostensibly as he had failed to reach his targets for the season,[38] but BBC Sports Editor David Bond reported that he had been sacked for his poor communication and relationships with players and executives.[39] In his place was appointed the Chilean Manuel Pellegrini.[40] In Pellegrinis first season, City won the League Cup[41] and regained the Premier League title on the last day of the season.[42] L1 = Level 1 of the football league system; L2 = Level 2 of the football league system; L3 = Level 3 of the football league system. Manchester Citys home colours are sky blue and white. Traditional away kit colours have been either maroon or (from the 1960s) red and black; however, in recent years several different colours have been used. The origins of the clubs home colours are unclear, but there is evidence that the club has worn blue since 1892 or earlier. A booklet entitled Famous Football Clubs  Manchester City published in the 1940s indicates that West Gorton (St. Marks) originally played in scarlet and black, and reports dating from 1884 describe the team wearing black jerseys bearing a white cross, showing the clubs origins as a church side.[43] The red and black away colours used infrequently yet recurrently come from former assistant manager Malcolm Allison, who believed that adopting the colours of A.C. Milan would inspire City to glory.[44] Allisons theory worked, with City winning the 1969 FA Cup Final, 1970 League Cup Final and the 1970 European Cup Winners Cup Final in red and black stripes as opposed to the clubs home kit of sky blue. City have previously worn three other badges on their shirts, prior to their current badge which was implemented in 2016. The first, introduced in 1970, was based on designs which had been used on official club documentation since the mid-1960s. It consisted of a circular badge which used the same shield as the current badge, inside a circle bearing the name of the club. In 1972, this was replaced by a variation which replaced the lower half of the shield with the red rose of Lancashire. On occasions when Manchester City plays in a major cup final, the usual badge has not been used; instead shirts bearing a badge of the arms of the City of Manchester are used, as a symbol of pride in representing the city of Manchester at a major event. This practice originates from a time when the players shirts did not normally bear a badge of any kind, but has continued throughout the history of the club.[45] For the 2011 FA Cup Final, City used the usual badge with a special legend, but the Manchester coat of arms was included as a small monochrome logo in the numbers on the back of players shirts.[46] A new club badge was adopted in 1997, as a result of the previous badge being ineligible for registration as a trademark. This badge was based on the arms of the city of Manchester, and consisted of a shield in front of a golden eagle. The eagle is an old heraldic symbol of the city of Manchester; a golden eagle was added to the citys badge in 1958 (but has since been removed), representing the growing aviation industry. The shield features a ship on its upper half representing the Manchester Ship Canal, and three diagonal stripes in the lower half symbolise the citys three rivers  the Irwell, the Irk and the Medlock. The bottom of the badge bears the motto Superbia in Proelio, which translates as Pride in Battle in Latin. Above the eagle and shield are three stars, which are purely decorative. On 15 October 2015, following years of criticism from the fans over the design of the 1997 badge,[47] the club announced that they intended to carry out a fan consultation on whether to disregard the club badge and institute a new design.[47] After the consultation, the club announced in late November 2015 that the current club badge would be replaced in due course by a new version which would be designed in the style of the older, circular variants.[48] A design purporting to be the new badge was unintentionally leaked two days early prior to the official unveiling on 26 December 2015 by the IPO when the design was trademarked on 22 December.[49] The new design was officially unveiled at the clubs home match on 26 December against Sunderland.[50] Manchester Citys shirts have been sponsored by Etihad Airways since 2009. Previous sponsors have been Saab (198284), Philips (198487), Brother (198799), Eidos (19992002), First Advice (200204), and Thomas Cook (200407). Their kits have been manufactured by Nike since 2013. Prior manufacturers have been Umbro (197497, 200913), Kappa (199799), Le Coq Sportif (19992003, 200709), and Reebok (200307).

Since 2003, Manchester City have not issued the squad number 23. It was retired in memory of Marc-Vivien Fo, who was on loan to the club from Lyon at the time of his death on the field of play whilst playing for Cameroon in the 2003 Confederations Cup.[54] The following former Manchester City players and managers are inductees in the Manchester City F.C.

Since moving to the City of Manchester Stadium, Manchester Citys average attendances have been in the top six in England,[62] usually in excess of 40,000. Even in the late 1990s, when the club were relegated twice in three seasons and playing in the third tier of English football (then Division Two, now Football League One), home attendances were in the region of 30,000, compared to an average for the division of fewer than 8,000.[63] Research carried out by Manchester City in 2005 estimates a fanbase of 886,000 in the United Kingdom and a total in excess of 2 million worldwide, although since the purchase of the club by Sheikh Mansour and the clubs recent trophies, that figure has ballooned to many times that size.[64] Manchester Citys officially recognised supporters club is the Manchester City FC Supporters Club (1949), formed from a merger of two existing organisations in 2010: the Official Supporters Club (OSC) and the Centenary Supporters Association (CSA).[65] There have been several fanzines published by supporters; the longest running is King of the Kippax and it is the only one still published.[66] The City fans song of choice is a rendition of Blue Moon, which despite its melancholic theme is belted out with gusto as though it were a heroic anthem. City supporters tend to believe that unpredictability is an inherent trait of their team, and label unexpected results typical City.[67][68] Events that fans regard as typical City include Citys being the only reigning English champions ever to be relegated (in 1938), the only team to score and concede over 100 goals in the same season (195758),[69] or the more recent example that City were the only team to beat Chelsea in the 200405 Premier League, yet in the same season City were knocked out of the FA Cup by Oldham Athletic, a team two divisions lower. Manchester Citys biggest rivalry is with neighbours Manchester United, against whom they contest the Manchester derby. Before the Second World War, when travel to away games was rare, many Mancunian football fans regularly watched both teams even if considering themselves supporters of only one. This practice continued into the early 1960s but as travel became easier, and the cost of entry to matches rose, watching both teams became unusual and the rivalry intensified. A common stereotype is that City fans come from Manchester proper, while United fans come from elsewhere. A 2002 report by a researcher at Manchester Metropolitan University found that while it was true that a higher proportion of City season ticket holders came from Manchester postcode areas (40 compared to Uniteds 29), there were more United season ticket holders, the lower percentage being due to Uniteds higher overall number of season ticket holders (27,667 compared to Citys 16,481); not highlighted in the report was that within the City of Manchester itself, there were more City season ticket holders (approximately 4 for every 3 United). The report noted that since the compiling of data in 2001, the number of both City and United season ticket holders had risen; expansion of Uniteds ground and Citys move to the City of Manchester Stadium have caused season ticket sales to increase further.[70] Man City also has a rivalry with that of Everton F.C.[71] In the late 1980s, City fans started a craze of bringing inflatable objects to matches, primarily oversized bananas. One disputed explanation for the craze is that in a match against West Bromwich Albion chants from fans calling for the introduction of Imre Varadi as a substitute mutated into Imre Banana. Terraces packed with inflatable-waving supporters became a frequent sight in the 198889 season as the craze spread to other clubs (inflatable fish were seen at Grimsby Town), with the phenomenon reaching a peak at Citys match at Stoke City on 26 December 1988, a match declared by fanzines as a fancy dress party.[72] In 2010, City supporters adopted an exuberant dance, dubbed The Pozna, from fans of Polish club Lech Pozna.[73] The holding company of Manchester City F.C., Manchester City Limited, is a private limited company, with approximately 54 million shares in issue. The club has been in private hands since 2007, when the major shareholders agreed to sell their holdings to UK Sports Investments Limited (UKSIL), a company controlled by former Thailand prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra. UKSIL then made a formal offer to buy the shares held by several thousand small shareholders. Prior to the Thaksin takeover, the club was listed on the specialist independent equity market PLUS (formerly OFEX),[74] where it had been listed since 1995. On 6 July 2007, having acquired 75 of the shares, Thaksin de-listed the club and re-registered it as a private company.[75] By August UKSIL had acquired over 90 of the shares, and exercised its rights under the Companies Act to squeeze out the remaining shareholders, and acquire the entire shareholding. Thaksin Shinawatra became chairman of the club and two of Thaksins children, Pintongta and Oak Chinnawat also became directors. Former chairman John Wardle stayed on the board for a year, but resigned in July 2008 following Nike executive Garry Cooks appointment as executive chairman in May.[76] The club made a pre-tax loss of 11m in the year ending 31 May 2007, the final year for which accounts were published as a public company.[77] Thaksins purchase prompted a period of transfer spending at the club,[78] spending in around 30million,[79] whereas over the previous few seasons net spending had been among the lowest in the division. A year later, this investment was itself dwarfed by larger sums. On 1 September 2008, Abu Dhabi-based Abu Dhabi United Group Investment and Development Limited completed a takeover of Manchester City. The deal, worth a reported 200million, was announced on the morning of 1 September. It sparked various transfer deadline-day rumours and bids such as the clubs attempt to gazump Manchester Uniteds protracted bid to sign Dimitar Berbatov from Tottenham Hotspur for a fee in excess of 30million.[80][81] Minutes before the transfer window closed, the club signed Robinho from Real Madrid for a British record transfer fee of 32.5million.[82] The wealth of the new owners meant that in the summer of 2009, the club was able to finance the purchase of several experienced international players prior to the new season, spending more than any other club in the Premier League.[83] Created in the 201314 season to manage the global footballing interests of Abu Dhabi United Group, the City Football Group (CFG) is an umbrella corporation owning stakes in a network of global clubs for the purposes of resource sharing, academy networking and marketing. Through the City Football Group, City owns stakes in a number of clubs: Manchester Citys stadium is the City of Manchester Stadium, also known as Eastlands and the Etihad Stadium since July 2011 because of sponsorship commitments. The stadium is situated in East Manchester and is part of a 200-year operating lease from Manchester City Council after the 2002 Commonwealth Games. The stadium has been Citys home since the end of the 200203 season, when the club moved from Maine Road.[89] Before moving to the stadium, Manchester City spent in excess of 30million to convert it to football use. The field of play was lowered by several metres, adding another tier of seating around the entire pitch. A new North Stand was also built.[90] The inaugural match at the new stadium was a 21 win over FC Barcelona in a friendly match.[91] In August 2015, a 7,000 seat third tier on the South Stand was completed, in time for the start of the 201516 football season. Current capacity stands at 55,097. A North Stand third tier has planning approval and work on it is expected to begin by 2017, increasing capacity to around 61,000.[92] Manchester City have used several grounds during their history: after playing home matches at five stadiums between 1880 and 1887, the club settled at Hyde Road Football Stadium, its home for 36 years.[93] After a fire destroyed the Main Stand in 1920, the club started to seek a new site and moved to the 84-000 capacity Maine Road three years later. Maine Road, nicknamed the Wembley of the North by its designers, hosted the largest-ever crowd at an English club ground when 84,569 attended an FA Cup tie against Stoke City on 3 March 1934.[94] Though Maine Road was redeveloped several times over its 80-year lifespan, by 1995 its capacity was restricted to 32,000, prompting the search for a new ground which culminated in the move to the City of Manchester Stadium in 2003.

England, that plays in the Premier League, the top flight of English football. Founded as Stoke Ramblers in 1863 the club changed its name to Stoke in 1878 and then to Stoke City in 1925 after Stoke-on-Trent was granted city status. They are the second oldest professional football club in the world, after Notts County, and are one of the founding members of the Football League.[4] Their first, and to date only major trophy, the League Cup was won in 1972, when the team beat Chelsea 21. The clubs highest league finish in the top division is 4th, which was achieved in the 193536 and 194647 seasons. Stoke played in the FA Cup Final in 2011, finishing runners-up to Manchester City and have reached three FA Cup semi-finals; in 1899 then consecutively in 1971 and 1972. Stoke have competed in European football on three occasions, firstly in 197273 then in 197475 and most recently in 201112. The club has won the Football League Trophy twice, in 1992 and in 2000. Stokes home ground is the bet365 Stadium, a 28,116 all-seater stadium. Before the stadium was opened in 1997, the club was based at the Victoria Ground, which had been their home ground since 1878. The clubs nickname is The Potters, named after the pottery industry in Stoke-on-Trent and their traditional home kit is a red and white vertically striped shirt, white shorts and stockings. Stokes traditional rivals are Midlands clubs West Bromwich Albion and Wolverhampton Wanderers whilst their local rivals are Port Vale with whom they contest the Potteries derby.   Stoke City F.C. was formed in 1863 under the name Stoke Ramblers, when pupils of Charterhouse School formed a football club while apprentices at the North Staffordshire Railway works in Stoke-upon-Trent.[5] The clubs first documented match was in October 1868, against an EW May XV at the Victoria Cricket Club ground. Henry Almond, the clubs founder, was also captain, and scored the clubs first ever goal. During this period they played at the Victoria Cricket Ground; however, they switched to a nearby ground at Sweetings Field in 1875 to cope with rising attendances.[5] In 1878, the club merged with Stoke Victoria Cricket Club, and became Stoke Football Club.[5] They moved from their previous ground, Sweetings Field, to the Athletic Club ground, which soon became known as the Victoria Ground.[2] It was around this time that the club adopted their traditional red-and-white striped kit. In August 1885, the club turned professional.[5] Stoke were one of the twelve founding members of the Football League when it was introduced in 1888.[2] The club struggled in their first two seasons, 188889 and 188990, finishing bottom on both occasions.[6] In 1890 Stoke failed to be re-elected and joined the Football Alliance, which they won and thus were re-elected to the Football League. Stoke spent the next 15 seasons in the First Division and reached the FA Cup Semi-Final in the 189899 season before being relegated in 1907. Stoke went bankrupt and entered non-league football until 1914, when the First World War meant the Football League was suspended for four years. During the wartime period, Stoke entered the Lancashire Primary and Secondary leagues.[7] When football recommenced in August 1919, Stoke re-joined the league. The club became owners of the Victoria Ground in 1919. This was followed by the construction of the Butler Street stand, which increased the overall capacity of the ground to 50,000.[8] In 1925, Stoke-on-Trent was granted city status and this led the club to change its name to Stoke City F.C.[9] The 1930s saw the debut of clubs most celebrated player, Stanley Matthews. Matthews, who grew up in Hanley, was an apprentice at the club and made his first appearance in March 1932,[10] against Bury, at the age of 17.[11] By end of the decade, Matthews had established himself as an England international and as one of the best footballers of his generation. Stoke achieved promotion from the Second Division in 193233  as champions  however Matthews only featured in fifteen games in this season. He did however score his first goal for the club in a 31 win against local rivals Port Vale.[11] By 1934, the clubs average attendance had risen to over 23,000, which in turn allowed the club to give the manager Tom Mather increased transfer funds. The club was now considered one of the top teams in the country. It was in this period that the club recorded its record league win, a 103 win over West Bromwich Albion in February 1937. In April of that year, the club achieved its record league crowd  51,373 against Arsenal. Freddie Steeles 33 league goals in the 193637 season remains a club record.[11] Following the resumption of the FA Cup after World War II, tragedy struck on 9 March 1946, as 33 fans died and 520 were injured during a 6th round tie away against Bolton Wanderers. This came known as the Burnden Park disaster.[12] In 194647, Stoke mounted a serious title challenge. The club needed a win in their final game of the season to win the First Division title. However, a 21 defeat to Sheffield United meant the title went to Liverpool instead. Stanley Matthews left with 3 games remaining of the 194647 season, opting to join Blackpool at the age of 32.[12] Stoke were relegated from the First Division in 195253; during the season Bob McGrory resigned as the clubs manager after 17 years in the role.[13][14] Former Wolverhampton Wanderers defender Frank Taylor took over at the club looking to gain promotion back to the First Division. However, after seven seasons in the Second Division without promotion, Taylor was sacked. Taylor was shocked at being fired and vowed never to be associated with football again.[2] Tony Waddington was appointed as the clubs manager in June 1960.[15] He joined the club in 1952 as a coach, before being promoted to assistant manager in 1957. Waddington pulled off a significant coup by enticing Stanley Matthews  then 46 years old  back to the club, 14 years after he had departed.[16] The return of Matthews helped Stoke to an improved 8th position in 196162. Promotion was achieved in the following season, with Stoke finishing as champions.[16] In their first season back in the top flight, 196364, Waddington guided Stoke to a mid-table finish. Stoke reached the 1964 Football League Cup Final, which they lost 43 to Leicester City over two legs.[16] Waddington counted on experience; Dennis Viollet, Jackie Mudie, Roy Vernon, Maurice Setters and Jimmy McIlroy were all players signed in the latter stages of their careers. Matthews was awarded a knighthood for services to football in the 1965 New Years Honours list. This was followed by his final appearance for the club against Fulham in February 1965, shortly after his 50th birthday. Gordon Banks, Englands 1966 World Cup-winning goalkeeper, joined in 1967 for 52,000 from Leicester.[16] Regarded as the best goalkeeper in the world,[17][18] Banks proved to be a shrewd signing for Waddington as he helped the club maintain stability in the First Division.[16] During the close season of 1967 Stoke City played in the one-off United Soccer Association which imported clubs from Europe and South America. Stoke played as the Cleveland Stokers and finished as runner-up of the Eastern Division.[19] The club won its first major trophy on 4 March 1972 in the League Cup Final against Chelsea.[20] Stoke won 21 in front of a crowd of 97,852 at Wembley with goals from Terry Conroy and George Eastham.[21] Preceding this victory, Stoke had progressed through 11 games in order to reach the final. This included four games with West Ham United in the semi-final; the two-legged tie was replayed twice. Stoke fared well in the FA Cup; the club progressed to the semi-final stage in both the 197071 and 197172 seasons. However, on both occasions Stoke lost to Arsenal in a replay.[21] Stoke also competed in the UEFA Cup in 1972 and 1974 losing at the first attempt to 1. FC Kaiserslautern and Ajax respectively.[21] In January 1976 the roof of the Butler Street Stand was blown off in a storm.[22] The repair bill of nearly 250,000 put the club in financial trouble; key players such as Alan Hudson, Mike Pejic and Jimmy Greenhoff were sold to cover the repairs. With the team depleted, Stoke were relegated in the 197677 season. Waddington, after a spell of 17 years in charge, left the club after a 10 home defeat to Leicester in March 1977.[21][23] Waddington was replaced by George Eastham in March 1977; however, he could not prevent the clubs relegation to the Second Division in 197677. Eastham left in January 1978, after only 10 months in charge, and was replaced by Alan Durban from Shrewsbury Town. Durban achieved promotion to the First Division in the 197879 season,[21] but after consolidating the clubs position in the First Division he left to manage Sunderland in 1981.[24] Richie Barker was appointed for the 198182 season but was sacked in December 1983, and was replaced by Bill Asprey. Asprey decided to bring back veteran Alan Hudson, and the decision paid off as an improved second half of the season saw Stoke avoid relegation on the final day of the 198384 season.[24] The 198485 season proved to be disastrous. Stoke finished the season with only 17 points, with just 3 wins all season. Mick Mills was appointed player-manager for the 198586 season,[24] but was unable to sustain a challenge for promotion in his four seasons as manager and was sacked in November 1989. His successor, Alan Ball, Jr. became the clubs 5th manager in 10 years.[24] Ball struggled in his first season in charge, 198990, and Stoke were relegated to the third tier of English football after finishing bottom of the Second Division. Ball kept his job for the start of the following season, 199091, but departed during February 1991, in an indifferent season that saw Stoke finish 14th in the Third Division, Stokes lowest league position.[25] Balls successor, Lou Macari, was appointed in May 1991, prior to the start of the 199192 season. He clinched silverware for the club; the 1992 Football League Trophy was won with a 10 victory against Stockport County at Wembley, with Mark Stein scoring the only goal of the game. The following season, 199293, promotion was achieved from the third tier. Macari left for his boyhood club Celtic in October 1993 to be replaced by Joe Jordan; Stein also departed, in a club record 1.5m move to Chelsea.[25] Jordans tenure in charge was short, leaving the club less than a year after joining, and Stoke opted to re-appoint Lou Macari only 12 months after he had left. Stoke finished 4th in 199596 but were defeated in the play-off semi-final by Leicester City. Macari left the club at the end of the season; his last game in charge was the final league game at the Victoria Ground.[25] Mike Sheron, who was signed two years previously from Norwich City, was sold for a club record fee of 2.5m in 1997.[26] 199798 saw Stoke move to its new ground, the Britannia Stadium,[27] after 119 years at the Victoria Ground. Chic Bates, Macaris assistant, was appointed manager for the clubs first season in the new ground. He did not last long though, and was replaced by Chris Kamara in January 1998. Kamara could not improve the clubs fortunes either, and he too left in April. Alan Durban, previously Stokes manager two decades earlier, took charge for the remainder of season. Despite his best efforts, Durban was unable to keep the club up, as defeat against Manchester City on the final day of the season consigned Stoke to relegation to the third tier.[25] Brian Little, formerly manager of Aston Villa,[28] took charge for the 199899 season.[29] Despite an impressive start, the teams form tailed off dramatically in the latter stages of the season, which led to Little leaving the club at the end of the season. His successor, Gary Megson, was only in the job for four months. Megson was forced to depart following a takeover by Stoke Holding, an Icelandic consortium, who purchased a 66 share in Stoke City F.C. for the sum of 6.6m.[22] Stoke became the first Icelandic-owned football club outside of Iceland. They appointed the clubs first foreign manager, Gudjon Thordarson, who helped Stoke win the Football League Trophy in the 19992000 season, with a 21 win over Bristol City in front of a crowd of 85,057 at Wembley.[9][30] Thordarson achieved promotion at the third time of asking in 200102 after previous play-off defeats against Gillingham and Walsall.[31] Cardiff City were defeated in the semi-final before a 20 win against Brentford at the Millennium Stadium secured promotion. Despite achieving the goal of promotion, Thordarson was sacked by Gunnar Gslason just five days later.[31][32] Steve Cotterill was drafted in as Thordarsons replacement prior to the start of the 200203 season,[31] but quit in October 2002 after only 4 months in charge. Tony Pulis was appointed as Stokes new manager shortly after.[9][33] Pulis steered Stoke clear of relegation,[31] with a 10 win over Reading on the final day of the season keeping the club in the division.[34] However, Pulis was sacked at the end of the 200405 season, following disagreement between himself and the clubs owners.[35] Dutch manager Johan Boskamp was named as Pulis successor on 29 June 2005, only a day after Pulis was sacked.[36] Boskamp brought in a number of new players from Europe but, his side was inconsistent, and only a mid-table finish was achieved.[37] Boskamp left at the end of the 200506 season, amidst a takeover bid by former chairman Peter Coates.[38] On 23 May 2006, Coates completed his takeover of Stoke City, marking the end of Gunnar Gslasons chairmanship of the club.[39] Coates chose former manager Tony Pulis as Boskamps successor in June 2006.[40] Pulis took Stoke close to a play-off place, but an eventual 8th-place finish was achieved in the 200607 season.[41] Stoke won automatic promotion to the Premier League on the final day of the 200708 season, finishing in 2nd place in the Championship.[42] A 31 defeat to Bolton Wanderers on the opening day of the 200809 season saw Stoke written off by many media outlets as relegation certainties.[43] Stoke managed to turn the Britannia Stadium into a fortress, making it difficult for teams to pick up points there. In their first home game, Stoke managed to beat Aston Villa 32,[44] and wins also came against Tottenham Hotspur,[45] Arsenal,[46] Sunderland[47] and West Bromwich Albion.[48] After a 21 win at Hull City,[49] Stoke confirmed their place in the Premier League as the Potters finished 12th in their return to the top flight, with a total of 45 points.[50] Stoke finished the following 200910 season in a respectable 11th place, with 47 points. Stoke also made it to the quarter finals of the FA Cup for the first time since 1972, beating York City, Arsenal and Manchester City before losing out to eventual winners Chelsea. Stoke reached the FA Cup Final for the first time, beating Cardiff City, Wolverhampton Wanderers, Brighton & Hove Albion, West Ham United and a famous win of 50 against Bolton Wanderers (the biggest post war FA Cup Semi-Final victory).[51] However, they lost the final 10 to Manchester City.[52] By reaching the final, Stoke qualified for the 201112 UEFA Europa League.[53] In the UEFA Europa League Stoke advanced past Hajduk Split, FC Thun, and a tough group containing Beikta, Dynamo Kyiv and Maccabi Tel Aviv which Stoke managed to progress through finishing in second position. Citys reward was a tie against Spanish giants Valencia and despite putting up a spirited 2nd leg performance Stoke went out 20 on aggregate. In the Premier League Stoke made the high-profile signing of Peter Crouch as they finished in a mid-table position for a fourth time. The 201213 season saw Stoke make little progress, and Pulis left the club by mutual consent on 21 May 2013.[54] He was replaced by fellow Welshman Mark Hughes who signed a three-year contract on 30 May 2013.[55][56] Hughes led Stoke to a ninth-place finish in 201314, their highest position in the Premier League and best finish since 197475.[57] The 201415 season saw Stoke again finish in 9th position this time with 54 points.[58] Despite breaking their transfer record twice on Xherdan Shaqiri and then Giannelli Imbula, in 201516, Stoke did not make any progression and finished in ninth position for a third season running.[59] Stoke declined in 201617, finishing in 13th position.[60] It is not clear where Stokes original playing fields were located. Their first pitch was certainly in the site of a present burial ground in Lonsdale Street, although there is evidence that they also played on land near to the Copeland Arms public house on Campbell Road.[2] In 1875 they moved to Sweetings Field, which was owned by the mayor of Stoke, Alderman Sweeting.[2] It is estimated that as many as 200250 spectators were attending home matches at Sweetings Field, paying one penny for admission. Stoke were to stay at Sweetings Field until a merger with the Stoke Victoria Cricket Club in March 1878, when Stoke moved to the Victoria Ground.[2] The first match to be played at the Victoria Ground was a friendly against Talke Rangers in the 28 March 1878; Stoke won 10 in front of 2,500 fans.[2] The ground was originally an oval shape to cater for athletics, and this shape was retained for the next 30 years. Major development work began in the 1920s, and by 1930 the ground had lost its original shape.[2] By 1935 the ground capacity was up to the 50,000 mark. A record crowd of 51,380 packed into the Ground on 29 March 1937 to watch a league game against Arsenal.[2] Floodlights were installed in 1956 and another new main stand was built. Over the weekend of the 3/4 in January 1976, gale-force winds blew the roof off the Butler Street Stand.[2] Stoke played a home League match against Middlesbrough at Vale Park whilst repair work was on-going.[2] The Stoke End Stand was improved in 1979 and through the 1980s more improvements were made. By 1995 Stoke drew up plans to make the ground an all seater stadium, to comply with the Taylor Report. However, the club decided it would be better to leave the Victoria Ground and re-locate to a new site.[2] In 1997, Stoke left the Victoria Ground after 119 years, and moved to the modern 28,384 all seater Britannia Stadium at a cost of 14.7million. Stoke struggled at first to adjust to their new surroundings and were relegated to the third tier in the first season at the new ground. In 2002 a record 28,218 attended an FA Cup match against Everton. With Stoke gaining promotion to the Premier League in 2008 attendances increased; however, the capacity was reduced to 27,500 due to segregation.[61] The name of the ground was changed to the bet365 Stadium in June 2016.[62] While much of the support that the club enjoys is from the local Stoke-on-Trent area, there are a number of exile fan clubs, notably in London and stretching from Scandinavia to countries further afield such as Russia, the United States, and Australia.[63] A capacity crowd regularly turn out to see them in the Premier League.[64] Stoke have had problems in the past with football hooliganism in the 1970s, 80s, 90s and early 2000s which gave the club a bad reputation, this was to the actions by the Naughty Forty firm which associated itself with the club and was formed by supporter Mark Chester.[65][66][67] Mark Chester reformed himself and now works as a youth inclusion promoter.[68] In 2003, the BBC described Stoke City as having one of the most active and organised football hooligan firms in England. In response to these criticisms, the club introduced an Away Travel ID scheme;[69] this was subsequently suspended in 2008 as a result of improved behaviour and an enhanced reputation.[70] More recently, Stoke Citys fans and their stadium have been perceived as loud, friendly, passionate and modern,[71] welcoming as guests Sugar Ray Leonard[72] and Diego Maradona.[73] There is in the media now genuine admiration for the volume and volatility of the clubs loyal support.[71] Stoke announced that they will offer supporters free bus travel to every Premier League away game in the 201314 and 201415 seasons.[74] In November 2008, a group of Stoke fans were forced by the Greater Manchester Police to leave Manchester before a league match against Manchester United.[75] The Human Rights group Liberty took up the case of the fans,[76] and Greater Manchester police eventually apologised for their actions and the fans were awarded compensation.[77][78] Supporters of the club have adopted Delilah as their club anthem since the 1970s. It was adopted by the fans after a supporter was heard singing it in a local pub. Some of the songs original lyrics have been adapted for the terraces, but the essence of the song remains the same.[79] Stokes official club anthem is Well be with you which was recorded by the Stoke players prior to the 1972 Football League Cup Final.[2] Stokes traditional rivals are Midlands clubs West Bromwich Albion and Wolverhampton Wanderers.[2][80] Stokes local rivals are Port Vale, based in the Burslem area of Stoke-on-Trent. As the two clubs have regularly been in different divisions there have only been 46 league matches between the two sides, with the last match being in 2002.[81] Regardless of the lack of games, the Potteries derby is often a tight and close game of football with few goals being scored. Stoke have won 19 matches whilst Vale have won 15.[82] Stokes traditional kit is red and white striped shirts with white shorts and socks.[2] Their first strip was navy and cardinal hoops with white knickerbockers and hooped stockings.[2] This changed to black and blue hoops before the club settled on red and white stripes in 1883.[2] However, in 1891 the Football League decided that only one club could use one style of strip per season and Sunderland were allowed to take red and white stripes. So between 1891 and 1908 Stoke used a variety of kits with plain maroon being the most common.[2] In 1908 Stoke lost their League status and were able to finally revert to red and white and when they re-joined the league in 1919 the rule was scrapped.[2] Since then Stoke have forever used red and white striped shirts with the only time when they diverted from this was for two seasons in the mid-1980s which saw them wear a pin-striped shirt. Stokes first club crest was a stylised S which was used by players in 1882 who would stitch the crest on to their shirts, however this practice soon faded away.[2] In the 1950s Stoke began using the shield from the Stoke-on-Trent coat-of-arms which was used infrequently until 1977.[2] A new and simpler club crest was introduced a Stafford knot and pottery kiln represented local tradition while red and white stripes were also added.[2] This lasted until 1992 when the club decided to use the entire Stoke-on-Trent coat-of-arms which included the clubs name at the top of the crest.[2] They changed their crest in 2001 to the current version which includes their nickname The Potters. For the 201213 season they used a special version to mark the clubs 150th anniversary which included the clubs Latin motto Vis Unita Fortior (United Strength is Stronger).
